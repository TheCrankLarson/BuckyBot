These ancient keys are obtained by activating and scanning the Guardian Beacon structures that can be found in many of the surrounding star systems. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nGoodness knows what this particular establishment is doing with these keys (although its proprietor is rumoured to have Dark Wheel associations) but they want them fast, they want them now and that seems like a job for the Buckyball Racing Club. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \nThe race starts and ends at the aforementioned fleet carrier, designation  \" KEYS CUT WHILE-U-WAIT! KNQ-LTB \" . From there you'll need to visit three different Guardian Beacons, collect one key from each and bring them all back to the carrier. When you get back you'll need to show them your keys before you can land (I didn't like to ask why, the guy seemed kinda twitchy and I didn't want to lose the gig). So jettison them outside (within 3km of the carrier), photograph them with the carrier in view, then scoop them back up, land and sell them to the local commodity market. \n \nTo submit your time for the race please use the following Google form: \n \n RACE SUBMISSION FORM ​ \nYou'll need to include 7 screenshots of your run (all taken in-cockpit with the HUD clock visible): \n \n1) Landed on the carrier (having returned to the surface), ready to launch. \n \n2, 3  &  4) Taken while cargo scooping an ancient key from each of your three chosen Guardian Beacons. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n 5) Viewing your three glowing keys floating in space outside the fleet carrier. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n 6) Landed back on the fleet carrier. \n \n7) Selling your 3/3 keys to the carrier's commodity market. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n The time for your run is taken between the times shown on the HUD clock in screenshots 1 and 6. \n \nThere are two race classes you can enter, Unlimited (where you can fly any ship you want, engineered as much as you want), or Regulation Hauler which must be done in an un-engineered Hauler outfitted as shown in the following build: \n \n Regulation Hauler build ​ \nYou can use the '$' icon at the top of that page to find stations selling everything you need to build a regulation hauler. At the time of writing one of the nearest stations to Guardian space is Greenstein Vision in the HIP 23046 system so you could build and fly it out from there (which takes about 20 mins). Alternatively you could fly to the carrier in a longer range Unlimited class ship and then use the carrier's shipyard services to get your regulation build ship transferred out from the bubble. It's also possible that other commanders might offer bus rides out to the starting system in their own fleet carriers (see  \" Bus Timetable \"  below). Volunteers should apply in this thread or in the Buckyball Discord. \n \nIf you're entering the Regulation Hauler class then you'll need to include additional screenshots of the Modules list in your right-hand panel to show you have the correct build. \n \nThe race starts at 00:00 on Saturday 18th July 3306 and runs until 23:59 on Sunday 26th July 3306. \n \nGood luck, fly fast and collect those keys! \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t FAQ \n \nQ) How do I find those Guardian Beacons? \nA)  There are some great resources out there for finding Guardian Beacons, in particular: \n The hozbase sortable list ​ Canonn's interactive 3D map ​ \n Q) How do I go about getting a key from a Guardian Beacon? \nA)  I think I'll leave that for you to figure out yourself (hint: you'll need lasers) \n \n Q) Can I use collector limpets to scoop up the keys? \nA)  No. Although I'm not going to waste everyone's time asking for additional Unlimited Class screenshots proving you don't have a collector limpet controller fitted, please don't  - manual scooping is a part of this challenge. \n \n Q) Can I use video evidence instead of screenshots? \nA)  Yes, you can either video your run and then grab the necessary screenshots afterwards at your leisure or else just upload the entire video and send a link to that in your Google form submission. \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t Bus Timetable \n \n Crank Larson - departing Ross 1047 sometime Friday night \n Sgurr - departing the  \" bubble \"  on Tuesday \n ","wordList":["the","honourable","profession","of","key","cutting","has","been","around","since","shop","keepers","wore","ties","some","1400","years","later","and","although","remains","are","gone","premises","have","now","changed","somewhat","this","particular","establishment","nautilus-class","fleet","carrier","can","be","found","in","orbit","above","planet","synuefe","hp-e","b45-7","system","696","light","from","sol","it","collecting","very","kind","not","human","but","guardian","origin","these","ancient","keys","obtained","by","activating","scanning","beacon","structures","that","many","surrounding","star","systems","goodness","knows","what","is","doing","with","its","proprietor","rumoured","to","dark","wheel","associations","they","want","them","fast","seems","like","job","for","buckyball","racing","club","race","starts","ends","at","aforementioned","designation","cut","while-u-wait","knq-ltb","there","you","ll","need","visit","three","different","beacons","collect","one","each","bring","all","back","when","get","show","your","before","land","didn","ask","why","guy","seemed","kinda","twitchy","lose","gig","so","jettison","outside","within","3km","photograph","view","then","scoop","up","sell","local","commodity","market","submit","time","please","use","following","google","form","submission","include","screenshots","run","taken","in-cockpit","hud","clock","visible","landed","on","having","returned","surface","ready","launch","while","cargo","scooping","an","chosen","spoiler","viewing","glowing","floating","space","selling","between","times","shown","two","classes","enter","unlimited","where","fly","any","ship","engineered","as","much","or","regulation","hauler","which","must","done","un-engineered","outfitted","build","icon","top","page","find","stations","everything","writing","nearest","greenstein","vision","hip","23046","could","out","takes","about","20","mins","alternatively","longer","range","class","shipyard","services","transferred","bubble","also","possible","other","commanders","might","offer","bus","rides","starting","their","own","carriers","see","timetable","below","volunteers","should","apply","thread","discord","if","re","entering","additional","modules","list","right-hand","panel","correct","00","saturday","18th","july","3306","runs","until","23","59","sunday","26th","good","luck","those","faq","how","do","great","resources","finding","hozbase","sortable","canonn","interactive","3d","map","go","getting","think","leave","figure","yourself","hint","lasers","collector","limpets","no","going","waste","everyone","asking","proving","don","limpet","controller","fitted","manual","part","challenge","video","evidence","instead","yes","either","grab","necessary","afterwards","leisure","else","just","upload","entire","send","link","crank","larson","departing","ross","1047","sometime","friday","night","sgurr","tuesday"]},{"name":"THE A* CHALLENGE","author":"Raiko","date":"Standing Challenge","dateDate":"","infoUrl":"https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/buckyball-racing-club-presents-the-a-challenge-v2-0.516860/","bannerImage":"http://buckyballracing.org.uk/images/Astarchallenge_banner_new3.jpg","extractedInfo":"Fancy a shorter trip? Take a look at  the Club website  for our other races (roughly every 3-4 weeks)! \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n What is it? \n \nThe A* Challenge is simple: Fly from Sol (or Wolf 359) to Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy, and record your time for doing so. \n \nOf course, this being an endurance run there is a little bit of challenge in that, not least the troubles of plotting routes in the galactic core. The clock starts on launch from Galileo / Lomas Orbiter, and ends upon arrival at Sagittarius A*. The time recorded is total elapsed time, so that includes any breaks, time asleep, at work, whatever. The clock doesn't stop ticking when you're offline. \n \nSome take the challenge as a means to push the limits and see just how fast it can be done. Others have a go at just getting the best time for their ship class. Yet others are more about giving a permanent record of completing the trip, regardless of time. All are welcome to the A* Challenge. \n \nThe start line is  Galileo  in  Sol , or Lomas Orbiter in Wolf 359 for those who don't have access to Sol. \nThe finish line is at  Sagittarius A* . \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n Warning:  This is a long way. 25,900 light years, give or take. This is the marathon of the racing world, not a sprint - expect to spend upwards of 12 hours in the cockpit. Also, route plotting in the galactic core can be challenging, to say the least.  This thread  helps to explain why  (NOTE: Route plotter improvements since 3.0 have mostly solved this problem, but if you do have problems plotting, then Esvandiary's algorithm it still the likely solution). \n \n Classes \n \nEntries will be accepted in three classes: Classic, Neutron and Unlimited. \n \nClassic Class entries must abide by the following regulations: \n \n (Engineer-)modified modules are  not  permitted. \n Enhanced Performance Thrusters are  not  permitted. \n Items only available from technology brokers, including all modules based upon Guardian technology, are  not  permitted. \n The use of materials synthesis (e.g. FSD Injection or AFM refill) is  not  permitted. \n The use of FSD supercharging (from neutron stars or white dwarfs) is  not  permitted. \n (This class is thus comparable to all previous runs, and available to Commanders who do not have the Horizons season pass) \n \nNeutron Class is for entries that  do  make use of FSD supercharging from neutron stars (or white dwarfs), but would otherwise be eligible for Classic class (i.e. no engineering or materials synthesis). \n \nUnlimited Class is for entries that  do  make use of (engineer-)modified modules, Enhanced Thrusters, items from technology brokers and/or materials synthesis (e.g. FSD Injection). \n \n Rules and regulations \n \n \n Starting point is either Galileo (orbiting the Moon) in Sol, or Lomas Orbiter in Wolf 359 for those who don't have access to Sol. Record the start with a screenshot of the station clock on the launch pad. \n Finish line is entry to the Sagittarius A* system. Record the finish with a screenshot of the galaxy map showing the time and date with current location as Sagittarius A*. \n Entries only accepted for runs completed in Open Play, in the main game universe (runs in the beta universe(s) don't count). \n The A* Challenge is open to any ship, and to players on any platform (PC, Mac, Xbox or PS4). \n Like the Buckyball Runs, we operate on an honour basis here. There's nothing I can do to stop you from faking screenshots or using exploits. But where's the benefit in that? It wouldn't get you anything, except a lasting feeling of shame. This is all about doing the run for the fun of it, and because you can. \n \n History \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nBack in early April 3301, Commander Anuranium turned up for  Buckyball Run 7  after having only the week before conducted his own  little private challenge . He'd posted a picture of his clock at Galileo station, and then posted another picture of himself at Sagittarius A* roughly 13 hours later. Many of the regular Buckyball crew were impressed by this, and it got us to thinking - would there be any demand for hosting this as a recorded race? It turns out the answer was yes... \n \nThis event started as the  Buckyball Run A* , hosted by ElectricZ and Bucky. When that drew to a close after 3 months, we at the  Buckyball Racing Club  weren't prepared to let the challenge lie, so it has carried on ever since as The A* Challenge. Same rules (for Classic Class), same route, even the leaderboard was carried over, but sorry, no bumper stickers. \n \n The A* Challenge was hosted magnificently from July 3301 to sometime in 3305 by Cmdr Samwell Drakhyr . In June 3305 Cmdr Drakhyr was declared missing, having been last contacted with his trusty Lakon Type-6 Explorer  Deep Blue Yonder  somewhere in Exteriores Australis. \n \nIn July 3305, I took over hosting the A* Challenge until such time as Cmdr Drakhyr returns, or his escape pod is recovered. \n \nSee below for a summary of notable feats in the A* Challenge, along with the history of the record times for each ship type. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n 21 July 3301: Buckyball Run A* comes to an end, and The A* Challenge begins. At this point the overall record is  8 hours, 43 minutes and 43 seconds , set by Cmdr  Alot  in the Anaconda  Rhonda , following close competition with Cmdr Kligg's  Rub Tub . Second place was held by Cmdr Rusticolus with a time of 9 hours, 17 minutes and 30 seconds in the Asp Explorer  My Bare Asp . \n 2 August 3301: Cmdr Savanik became the 100th commander to complete the challenge, in the Asp Explorer  We Made It . \n 16 August 3301: Cmdr Farge secured the bottom rung of the leaderboard with a time of 104 days, 13 hours and 21 minutes in the Orca  Explorca . \n 8 November 3301: Cmdr  StokeMeAClipper  finally breaks Cmdr Alot's overall record after a little over five months, setting a time of  8 hours, 21 minutes and 13 seconds  in the Anaconda  Pinpoint 8 . This marked the start of the very top competitors running  without stellar body scanners  in order to absolutely maximise jump range. \n 6 December 3301: Cmdr  Alot  regains the top spot in  Rhonda  with a time of  8 hours, 7 minutes and 5 seconds . \n 24 January 3302: Despite already holding the top spot, Cmdr Alot decided that he was nonetheless determined to set a better time. With the first attempt not quite achieving the target, Alot self-destructed and started again. After  two  complete runs within 24 hours, Cmdr Alot became the first commander to break the eight-hour barrier, setting a record time of  7 hours, 56 minutes and 41 seconds . This remains the overall record for a ship not using engineer modifications or boosted jumps (from FSD injection or neutron stars). \n 25 February 3302: Cmdr Takaru Minari completes the challenge in the Anaconda  Dawnbringer  as the first leg of a fast trip to Beagle Point, reaching the far side of the galaxy in 25 and a half hours. \n 20 March 3302: Cmdr Asier's run in the Diamondback Explorer  A-D Zirconium  is the first run completed in virtual reality, using the Oculus Rift (as well as setting a ship type record). \n 17 June 3302: Cmdr Luke3107 became the 150th commander to complete the challenge, and the first to do so on Xbox One, in the Asp Explorer  Insert Name Here . \n 26 June 3302:  Unlimited class commences , with the first run in an engineer modified ship. Cmdr  Up2d4t3 's Anaconda  Goldie  sets a new overall record of  6 hours, 24 minutes and 32 seconds . \n 29 June 3302: Times in unlimited class start tumbling, as Cmdr  Allitnil  in the engineered Anaconda  Paradox Drive  breaks Up2d4t3's record after only three days, with a time of  5 hours, 29 minutes and 35 seconds . \n 10 August 3302: Having previously proven to be a contender in Standard class (see entry from 8 Nov 3301), Cmdr  StokeMeAClipper  returns with an engineered Anaconda,  Blacknight , to improve the Unlimited class record to  5 hours, 19 minutes and 22 seconds . \n 4 September 3302: The competition in Unlimited class continues, with Cmdr  Up2d4t3  returning for another run in  Goldie , bringing the record time down to  3 hours, 59 minutes and 9 seconds . This remains the fastest time without making use of supercharged jumps from neutron stars. \n 30 October 3302: While it had appeared that Cmdr Farge had an immovable grip on the bottom of the leaderboard, that proved not to be the case as Cmdr Matokla reported in, having finally reached Sagittarius A* after 218 days of travelling in the Asp Explorer  Apollo 13 . \n 24 March 3303: Cmdr  Allitnil  returned for another Unlimited class run in  Paradox Drive , using a new route and approach. The  use of the neutron star superhighway  (with its supercharged jumps) proved spectacularly successful, setting a new unlimited class (and overall) record time of  2 hours, 45 minutes and 39 seconds . \n 25 June 3303: Cmdr  Allitnil  extends his proof of the use of neutron star supercharging to unengineered ships, making a point that the Hauler could get a significant benefit from this approach. The successful run in  Highly Strung  marks the  start of the Neutron class  with an impressive time of  6 hours, 27 minutes and 39 seconds . \n 27 June 3303: Cmdr  Alot  returns to the course in the Anaconda  Rhonda , this time in Unlimited class. With a route making full use of neutron star supercharging, Alot succeeds in improving the Unlimited class (and overall) record to  2 hours, 12 minutes and 13 seconds . \n 24 September 3303: With an improved neutron star boosted route (and a bit of practice), Cmdr  Allitnil  returns in the Anaconda  Paradox Drive  to retake the Unlimited class (and overall) record to an amazing  2 hours, zero minutes and 58 seconds . \n 3 March 3304: Following improvements to the benefits that can be gained from engineering modules, Cmdr  Alot  returned to the course in an upgraded  Rhonda  the Anaconda, breaking the two-hour mark to take the Unlimited class and overall record with a blistering time of  one hour, fifty-five minutes and eleven seconds . \n 24 March 3304: Cmdr  Darplata94  takes the Diamondback Explorer  Atrox  down the neutron superhighway to set a new record for an unengineered ship (Neutron class) of  5 hours, 55 minutes and 28 seconds . \n 20 September 3304: Reverse engineering of alien technology from the mysterious  \" Guardians \"  allows Cmdrs to achieve unprecedented jump ranges, Cmdr  Up2d4t3  makes full use of these technological breakthroughs to take back the unlimited record once again in his Anaconda  Goldie , with a time of  one hour, fifty-three minutes and twenty-nine seconds . \n 15 August 3305: Cmdr  Numerlor  shaves a mere 26 seconds off the existing unlimited record, setting a new record time of  one hour, fifty-three minutes and three seconds  in his Anaconda  Raia . \n 1 September 3305: Cmdr  Up2d4t3  returned to the top of the table again in  Goldie , arriving at Sgr A* 53 seconds faster than Numerlor, with a time of  one hour, fifty-two minutes and ten seconds . \n 19 and 21 September 3305: Cmdr  turkwinif  breaks the unlimited record twice in two days the Anaconda  Liberty One , bringing the best time down to  one hour, forty-six minutes and thirty-two seconds . \n 23 September 3305: Cmdr  Alot  returns yet again in  Rhonda  to take back the unlimited record with a time of  one hour, thirty-seven minutes and forty-seven seconds . \n 27 November 3305: Cmdr  Razor16251  makes an unlimited class run in the Anaconda  Razcue  on the Xbox-One console in a time of  two hours,   forty eight minutes and forty eight seconds , this is the first console time to ever break Cmdr Luke3107's original console record from June 3302 . \n 15 April 3306: Cmdr  SilentPhoenix05  sets a new console record on Xbox-One of  two hours, eighteen minutes and fifty one soconds  in the Anaconda  I Believe I Can Jump. \n 30 April 3006: Cmdr  Goosefraba19  becomes the tenth different commander to hold the overall A* speedrun record, setting a new unlimited class record of  one hour, thirty-seven minutes and nineteen seconds  in the Anaconda  Phoenix . \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n How to enter \n \n \n Read all of these notes before starting! \n Post your intent to race in this thread (optional, but should get you some good luck wishes and might lead to friend requests from others underway at the same time so you can track each other's progress). Include the following: \n Your commander's name \n Ship name \n Ship type \n \n When ready to make the run, get to Galileo in Sol or Lomas Orbiter in Wolf 359. Make repairs, fuel up, ensure the ship is configured exactly how you want it for the run - it's a long way back if you miss something! \n Open the Outfitting screen and capture screenshots (F10) of your ship's configuration. Note that for this challenge, sufficient screenshots are required to cover  all  core internal compartments and  all  optional internal compartments. \n Return to the surface and prepare for launch (it is strongly suggested that you plot the first leg of your route before capturing a start time!). Remember, Open Play only (Solo or Private Group times don't count). \n Hit F10 to take another screenshot, or start your video capture, showing your start location, date and time. \n Launch and get going! \n Navigate your way to Sagittarius A*. \n Upon arrival in the Sagittarius A*, open up the galaxy map and take another screenshot showing your current position (i.e. the fact that you are in the Sagittarius A* system!) plus the date and time. Congratulations, you made it! \n Send a PM to me ( Raiko ), or email  raiko  < at >  buckyballracing  < dot >  org  < dot >  uk , with the following: \n Your commander's name \n Your ship's name \n Your ship type \n Your total race time \n Links to your screenshots: Outfitting, start time/location and finish time/location (if you've recorded video, please extract screenshots or short edited segments covering these three rather than just sending / linking to the entire video!) \n Please let me know if any special conditions apply (see below) * \n \n Having completed the 25,900LY run from Sol to Sag A*, you now have a wonderful opportunity: to turn around and fly all the way back again, by your own route and at your own pace. Enjoy! \n For more details on the information needed to evidence your race entry, including example screenshots, see the  How to Enter  page of the Buckyball Racing Club website. \n \n* Special conditions include: runs made on Xbox One; runs made on PS4; runs made on Oculus (or other) VR; runs made while in a wing; use of supercharged jumps from neutron stars / white dwarfs. \n \n Full leaderboards \n \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Thinking of making a run?

a long time now I've been wanting to create a standing SRV time trial race which people can enter whenever they fancy (and as often as they fancy), something akin to the Buckyball A* Challenge (but for SRVs) that could run for many years. \n \nI think I've finally found the perfect location. \n \nIt takes place on the fairly legendary Pomeche 2 C, a rocky ice world in the Pomeche system, just under 100ly from Sol. The entire surface of Pomeche 2 C is covered in vast ridges whose sheer sides fall away into deep blue canyons on either side and this race involves driving along the top of one such ridge which runs almost exactly East/West across the 13th parallel. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nThe race starts next to a large landing area at coordinates 13°, -60° (heading West on a bearing of 270°) and has been broken into three separate challenges of increasing difficulty, each with its own scoreboard. \n \nThe  \" Blue Run \"  is roughly 26km long and covers the first, fairly wide section (suitable for most competent SRV drivers) with a finish line anywhere across the ridge at longitude -62°. \n \nThe  \" Red Run \"  is 52km long and covers both this and the next, somewhat narrower section (aimed at intermediate level SRV drivers) finishing at longitude -64°. \n \nAnd the  \" Black Run \"  (for experts only) is roughly 65km long, covering both the Blue and Red sections plus a final stage of treacherously rocky and narrow blue ice which finishes on the ridge at -65°. \n \nA run can include one, two or all three sections of the race and must always begin parked in the SRV, at zero speed and altitude, somewhere near latitude 13° and on (or behind) longitude -60°. At this point you need to capture an image which shows both the coordinates and the clock on your SRV's HUD. You then race (in the SRV - no ships!!) on a rough heading of 270° to the blue finish line at -62° where, if you wish, you can stop. Alternatively you can continue on to the red finish line at -64° where again you may stop. Finally, for the truly adventurous, you can continue on to the final black finish line at -65°. At each finish line, in order to qualify for that section you must capture an image which again shows the coordinates and the clock and must also show you clearly still up on the ridge and at an altitude below 50m. If you are above 50m then your finish screenshot must be taken once you've fallen back below that altitude (and still on the ridge). You do not need to be stationary in the finish screenshots. \n \nIf you wish you can video your run and then extract the necessary screenshots at the end. This has the advantage that you don't need to worry about hitting the screenshot key at key moments and also allows you to capture the exact moment when you cross a finish line, potentially shaving valuable seconds off your submitted time. If at all possible tho', please don't just send me the video, do try to capture the requested set of screenshots as this will make it much easier for me to quickly process your submission and get the scoreboard updated. \n \nHere's an acceptable set of screenshots for all three stages. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Starting screenshot. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nBlue run finish screenshot. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nRed run finish screenshot. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nBlack run finish screenshot. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \nOnce you have your screenshots (one for the start and one for each stage that you're entering) you need to upload them to an image sharing website such as imgur.com and then fill in the following web form: \n \n OFFICIAL POMECHE RIDGE CHALLENGE RACE SUBMISSION FORM ​ \nI will check submissions and add verified times into a running scoreboard which I will maintain here in this forum thread. The race is open across all platforms, can be run in any game mode and will run for as long as I'm still around and the topography of Pomeche 2 C remains relatively unchanged. \n \nCurrently there are no prizes on offer other than the glory of knowing that you are the greatest SRV driver that Elite: Dangerous has ever seen! \n \nDrive hard commanders and stay on the ridge! \n \n \n FAQ and Tips \n \nQ)  Is there some in-game way of easily navigating to those planetary coordinates? \nA) I think we all know the answer but I appreciate the subtle dig at Frontier to add this feature. Until we get planetary bookmarks tho' there are a few things that can help. The first is a handy infographic that tells you which heading to take in order to make the latitude and longitude numbers change in the direction you want. \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t

direct you down to a given landing spot as well as providing a HUD overlay to point you in the right direction. \n \nQ)  Can I submit only some parts of my run? \nA) Yes - if, for example, you already have better times on the scoreboard for the Blue section but manage to turn in better Red and Black section times then just make it clear in your submission that that is what you want to do and your previous Blue time will still stand. \n \nQ)  Am I allowed to repair the SRV during my run? \nA) Yes - you can repair the SRV as many times as necessary. \n \nQ)  Do I have to start off right behind those annoying rocks at 13°,-60°? \nA) Your start longitude must be on or before -60° (i.e. -59.?°) and you should be close to 13° but it doesn't have to be exact if you want to shift left or right a bit to avoid those rocks. \n \nQ)  Can I start the race parked on the back of my ship? \nA) No - no ship dismiss boost starts are permitted for this race. \n \nQ)  If I cross a finish line above 50m altitude and take my screenshot some time later when I'm back down on the ridge is my finish time taken from the screenshot or when I crossed the line? \nA) Your time is taken from the screenshot (i.e. at the nearest point on or after the finish line when your altitude drops below 50m). \n \nQ)  What exactly do you mean by  \" clearly still up on the ridge \" ? \nA) For the blue run somewhere between 12.4100 and 12.5300, for the red run somewhere between 12.4100 and 12.4700 and for the black run somewhere between 12.4000 and 12.5000. \n \n \n The leaderboard \n

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nFeast your eyes on that location folks! If ever there was a planetary base begging to be the home of an SRV challenge then Cortes Base in the Ross 1047 system has to be it! \n \n (I would like to thank Cmdrs graememk and DeadMeatGF of Hutton Orbital's operation HOT MESS for bringing this location to my attention) \n \nFor people who've already taken part in the  Pomeche Ridge Challenge , think of this as a little bonus challenge, and if you haven't tried the  Pomeche Ridge Challenge , then consider this a training ground for what I still reckon is the toughest test of SRV driving skill in the galaxy. \n \nSo basically this challenge works as follows. \n \nYou start off in your SRV parked on top one of the  \" outrigger \"  ramps on the North Eastern side of the base (facing along the ridge on a heading of roughly 52°). You should have Cortes base pre-targeted via the left-hand contacts panel (so you can see your distance to the center of the city) and it's also a good idea to have repair synthesis pre-selected in the right-hand inventory panel (so it's right there if and when you need it). The SRV should be just behind the line between the last set of lights on the ramp as shown in the following image. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nPick a suitable start time (ideally when the seconds hit :00 in the HUD clock) and, when that time ticks over ... \n \nGO GO GO! \n \nYour objective is to drive as fast as you can along the ridge until the distance back to the  \" planetary port \"  shows at least 10.0 km, then skid to a stop, do a U-turn and drive back towards the city again. The clock stops when your SRV makes contact with any part of the city. \n \nHere's the  \" route map \"  for what it's worth .. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n.. and here's a (speeded up) demonstration video of a fairly fast run .. \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \nIn order to formally enter your run for the scoreboard that I'll be maintaining in this forum thread you will ideally need to video the whole of your run. Alternatively you can just take three screenshots - one showing the SRV stationary on the ramp behind the start line - one showing a distance back to the city of at least 10.0 km - and one clearly showing the SRV in contact with the city again. Your time is the difference between the time on the HUD at the start line with the SRV stationary and the time on the HUD at the point where you  \" hit \"  the city again. The middle screenshot is required to prove you drove out to the 10.0 km point. \n \nOnce you've completed your run and have your evidence use the following Google form to submit your entry. \n \n OFFICIAL CORTES DRAG STRIP CHALLENGE SUBMISSION FORM ​ \n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n (last updated: 7/04/3306) \n \n \n \nFAQ \n \nQ)  Do I need to survive the run? \nA) No. As long as you can get an image showing the SRV back in contact with the city it doesn't matter if you blow up shortly afterwards (so feel free to hurl yourselves into the city wall at full speed). You do need to stay alive for the entire duration of the run tho! (no blowing up and respawning to get back to the base!). \n \nQ)  Can I repair the SRV during the run? \nA) Yes. Repair synthesis is allowed, use as much as you like. \n \nQ)  Does it matter which ramp I start on? \nA) No, feel free to experiment for the optimum start position. Although the ramp used for the illustration above seems fairly ideal it does tend to direct you over a crater and dangerously close to the left hand side of the ridge so starting further across to the right  \" might \"  be better? \n \n \n \n BONUS CHALLENGE - The Cortes Base Jump \n \nWhile you're here why not try your hand at the Cortes Base Jump. The idea is simply this - can you jump the SRV clear over the city? \n \nYou can start with as much of a run-up as you like (on the ground - no riding on the back of ships to give you a boost!). You're allowed to use the outside ramps and sloping wall of the city as a kicker to launch you up and across but the SRV should then not touch anything else until it's flown clear over the city and landed back on the ground on the opposite side. You need to be able to come to a stop still on the ridge for a completely successfull jump (if you fly off the ridge for example then it doesn't count). \n \nHere's a couple of demonstration jumps to show you what I mean. \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \nThere's no leaderboard for this (as I couldn't think of an especially good way to rate your jumps) but if you try this then please post videos of your attempts in this thread for our entertainment. \n \n \n \nAlso - if that isn't enough race action for you - the Elite Racers are also hosting a time trial event at this location so why not head on over to their forum thread now and give their challenge a try too! \n \n ","wordList":["feast","your","eyes","on","that","location","folks","if","ever","there","was","planetary","base","begging","to","be","the","home","of","an","srv","challenge","then","cortes","in","ross","1047","system","has","it","would","like","thank","cmdrs","graememk","and","deadmeatgf","hutton","orbital","operation","hot","mess","for","bringing","this","my","attention","people","who","ve","already","taken","part","pomeche","ridge","think","as","little","bonus","you","haven","tried","consider","training","ground","what","still","reckon","is","toughest","test","driving","skill","galaxy","so","basically","works","follows","start","off","parked","top","one","outrigger","ramps","north","eastern","side","facing","along","heading","roughly","52","should","have","pre-targeted","via","left-hand","contacts","panel","can","see","distance","center","city","also","good","idea","repair","synthesis","pre-selected","right-hand","inventory","right","when","need","just","behind","line","between","last","set","lights","ramp","shown","following","image","pick","suitable","time","ideally","seconds","hit","00","hud","clock","ticks","over","go","objective","drive","fast","until","back","port","shows","at","least","10","km","skid","stop","do","u-turn","towards","again","stops","makes","contact","with","any","here","route","map","worth","speeded","up","demonstration","video","fairly","run","order","formally","enter","scoreboard","ll","maintaining","forum","thread","will","whole","alternatively","take","three","screenshots","showing","stationary","clearly","difference","point","where","middle","screenshot","required","prove","drove","out","once","completed","evidence","use","google","form","submit","entry","official","drag","strip","submission","updated","04","3306","faq","survive","no","long","get","doesn","matter","blow","shortly","afterwards","feel","free","hurl","yourselves","into","wall","full","speed","stay","alive","entire","duration","tho","blowing","respawning","during","yes","allowed","much","does","which","experiment","optimum","position","although","used","illustration","above","seems","ideal","tend","direct","crater","dangerously","close","left","hand","starting","further","across","might","better","jump","while","re","why","not","try","simply","clear","run-up","riding","ships","give","boost","outside","sloping","kicker","launch","but","touch","anything","else","flown","landed","opposite","able","come","completely","successfull","fly","example","count","couple","jumps","show","mean","leaderboard","couldn","especially","way","rate","please","post","videos","attempts","our","entertainment","isn","enough","race","action","elite","racers","are","hosting","trial","event","head","their","now","too"]},{"name":"THE COLONIA TROPHY DASH","author":"Edelgard von Rhein","date":"Standing Challenge","dateDate":"","infoUrl":"https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-buckyball-racing-club-presents-the-colonia-trophy-dash.520726/","bannerImage":"http://buckyballracing.org.uk/images/colonia_trophy_dash.png","extractedInfo":"The Buckyball Racing Club Presents: The Colonia Trophy Dash: a Standing Challenge Event in Colonia \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n ​ The Colonia Trophy Dash is a time trial race that is intended to be an ongoing standing challenge with all waypoints in the Colonia region. All waypoints accept all three size classes of ship, so all ship types can compete. In a similar manner to the A* Challenge, the race will be split into Classic and Unlimited classes and the fastest times for each ship class will also be recorded. \n. \nThere are two separate race classes: Classic and Unlimited. In Classic, no Engineering, FSD synthesis or Guardian technology is permitted but Neutron star and White Dwarf jet cone boosts are permitted: this is intended to both allow a level playing field and to encourage new players to race. In Unlimited, Engineering, FSD synthesis and Guardian Technology are all permitted. The use of Supercruise Assist and Docking Computers is not allowed in either category. \n. \nNote that it is necessary to have Elite: Dangerous: Horizons to participate.The Buckyball Racing Club's Discord server ( https://discord.gg/YwxcsCf ) and website ( http://www.buckyballracing.org.uk ) provide helpful information on entering a race and hints and tips for improving your flying skills. \n. \nRace times in Classic class are expected to vary considerably but a vessel with a decent jump range should be able to complete the course in under an hour, depending on chance factors such as planetary alignments. In comparison, Unlimited times are anticipated to be approximately 45 minutes or less but will also vary significantly by ship, loadout and pilot experience, with the very top pilots possibly completing the course in under 25 minutes in racing-optimised ships. Participants may take part in any play mode they wish but Open play is encouraged in order to meet other racers on the course. \n \n Race Outline ​ The race begins at the Dove Enigma megaship in the Colonia system and ends at Jaques station, also in Colonia. After leaving the Dove Enigma, the course proceeds through the following locations, in order, before returning to Jaques: \n \n Colonia Dream, Ratraii. (Coriolis) \n Moore's Charm, Luchtaine. (Asteroid Base) \n Brazilian Dream, Santos Dumont. (Plantery Port) \n Vera Rubin Complex, Garuda. (Planetary Port) \n Pedersen's Legacy, Mobia. (Planetary Port) \n Fort Mug, Eol Procul Centauri. (Planetary Port) \n Mortimer's Charm, Kinesi. (Orbis) \n The starting point for the race is the Megaship  Dove Enigma . Large landing pad availability is limited so, to race in Open if there are no free pads, it is possible to dock in Solo mode and then switch to Open once docked: a new instance will be created to accommodate you. Remember that, after landing, the pad still needs to turn around as normal so remember to enter the hangar and then return to the surface to avoid beginning with the pad turning around. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \nThe megaship  Dove Engima  seen against the background of the Colonia Nebula. \n\t\t \n\t \n The first port of call in the race is Colonia Dream, the first Coriolis to be constructed in the Colonia region after Jaques' arrival. It is in close orbit of a moon that is itself in close orbit of its parent planet. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \nThe Coriolis station  Colonia Dream  seen next to Ratraii A 3 a, with Ratraii A 3 in the background. \n\t\t \n\t \n The next stop is the Luchtaine system, where the Engineer Mel Brandon operates from The Brig, but the race calls instead at the nearby asteroid base  Moore's Charm , located adjacent to the gas giant's rings. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \nThe asteroid base  Moore's Charm , located adjacent to the rings of Luchtaine A 1. \n\t\t \n\t \n The third stop on the race is a challenging high-gravity environment, at the planetary port  Brazilian Dream  on the ringed high metal content world Santos Dumont 6. The surface gravity here is 2.98g but the view is spectacular, as the base is located at high latitude and has a good view of the rings. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \nThe planetary port  Brazilian Dream , on Santos Dumont 6, currently has the highest surface gravity of any settlement in Colonia. \n\t\t \n\t \n After the high-gravity of the previous stop, comes a more complex low-gravity environment, with  Vera Rubin Complex  which is located on one of a pair of binary moons orbiting Garuda A 1. At 0.06g, this is the lowest gravity port of call in the race. This port is almost always on the dark side of the moon (it may be possible for it to be on the daylight side but it is very difficult to predict when this might happen). \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \nThe planetary port  Vera Rubin Complex , on Garuda A 1 b, which is a binary moon with A 1 a seen in shadow in the background, with the gas giant A 1 in the distance. \n\t\t \n\t \n Another relatively low gravity planetary port follows, with  Pedersen's Legacy  on Mobia A 1 a. This metal-rich moon is notable for its bright colour, its close orbit of its parent planet and is potato shape. The base can be found inside a crater that is, in turn, inside one of the largest impact craters on the moon. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n Pedersen's Legacy  on Mobia A 1 a is located in a crater inside one of the largest impact craters on this small, metal-rich moon. \n\t\t \n\t \n The final planetary port in the race is  Fort Mug , located on the surface of the innermost planet of Eol Procul Centauri, which is named Hutton Moon. This is a moderately high gravity environment, with a surface gravity of 1.31g. The planet is tidally locked and the base is on the dark side. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n Fort Mug  on the planet Hutton Moon, the innermost world in Eol Procul Centauri, is a moderately high gravity environment and is in perpetual night thanks to tidal locking. \n\t\t \n\t \n The penultimate port of call is the Orbis station  Mortimer's Charm . Located adjacent to the rings of Kinesi 5, it commands spectacular views of this Earth-like World. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n Mortimer's Charm  in orbit of a rare ringed Earth-like World, Kinesi 5, is the only Orbis station in the race, located adjacent to the planet's rings. \n\t\t \n\t \n Finally, the race ends where it all began in Colonia: Jaques station. Ever since its famous misjump, this station has remained in a highly-inclined orbit of the ringed gas giant now known as Colonia 4. There are several tourist beacons close to the station and tour ships can be seen approaching and leaving the station constantly. There is a detention centre in a nearby system if you should have an 'accident' on approach! Jaques also harbours a Guardian Tech Broker and has some of the best outfitting in the region but Colonia still lacks many A-rated modules. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n Jaques station  seen against the backdrop of the ringed gas giant Colonia 4, has a polar orbit that often provides spectacular views of the gas giant's ring system. \n\t\t \n\t \n Submitting a Race Entry ​ The race is an ongoing standing challenge, so entries are welcome at any time. Please declare an intent to race in this thread, in order that other participants can look out for you on the course. It is not required if you prefer not to, however.

3301! \n \nOnce again, every day is a party day in Weyl Gateway, Alacarakmo and the hottest club in Weyl is Lonnigans,  where all the extras are included. \n \nDespite the best attempts by the Feds and the Corps to close down all black market activities in the station, Anthony  \" Fat Tony \"  Lonnigan and Enoch  \" Little Nuk \"  Lonnigan (aka the Lonnigan Brothers) have exploited a minor loophole in interstellar trade regulations and now the hard working citizens of Weyl are boogying the night away under the  Geawen Dance Dust  sprinklers at Lonnigans. The bar is fully stocked with everything from  Centauri Mega Gin  to  Wuthielo Ku Froth , and if you need something stronger, then a selection of the Galaxy's finest narcotics are freely available. So whether you want to smoke some  Onionhead , snort a little  Tarach Spice  or inject some good old  Wolf Fesh , then Tony and Nuk have got your needs covered. \n \n Happy days? You bet! \n \nFat Tony can't stop grinnin' as he sits back legally puffing on huge  Kamitra Cigars , while Little Nuk counts the credits. Even Mrs Lonnigan is happy these days - Tony's girls are  real busy  upstairs, but there's still more than enough  Motrona Experience Jelly  left over for her to enjoy as many of her infamous ultimate spa experiences as she likes. \n \nYes, all the Lonnigan family are happy these days; rolling in easy credits, and it's all above board too. \n \nThe only trouble is, the very same legal loophole that let Tony import illicit contraband into Weyl Gateway has done the very same thing at starports across the galaxy! And that means that The Black Riband, the Lonnigan Brothers' very own  \" quasi-legal \"  (okay, okay! totally illegal) Buckyball smuggling challenge has had to be shut down. 'Cus where's the fun in smuggling legal goods? \n \nIf there's one thing the brothers loved even more than mountains of easy credits, it was having their very own standing Buckyball challenge - and one that was officially endorsed by the Buckyball Racing Club too! \n \nThat threatened to seriously dampen the party spirit at Lonnigans, until Little Nuk had the spectacularly nasty idea of reviving the Iron Bucky Trophy from Fat Tony's Festival of Racing as a standing Buckyball challenge. Advancements in drive technology would be sure to make racers think they could easily break Cmdr Cookiehole's IronBucky record, and many of them were sure to crash out and explode. Tony and Nuk could enjoy watching those explosions from the comfort of their club, and a great start to 3305 would just get better. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n Fat Tony and Little Nuk - The Lonnegan Brothers ​ \n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n What is the Iron Bucky Trophy? \n \nOriginally a part of Fat Tony's Festival of Racing - a BRC event from 3303 - the Iron Bucky Trophy - the  \" IronBucky \"  - requires commanders to attempt to complete all three of the festival's main events - The Station Scramble, The Bubble Tour and The Wasat Rally - in a single session without making repairs or using synthesis. IronBucky runs require pre-registration of an approximate starting time, and the run actually has to begin no more than 15 minutes after this time. \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t ​ Each section of the IronBucky begins and ends at Brash Dock in the Siren system, and so a full run requires the commander to dock back at Brash Dock three times. The commander has the option to swap ships once at Brash Dock, but no ship repairs can be made and no outfitting changes, and so one of the ships must have a planetary vehicle hangar fitted in order to complete the Wasat Rally section. \n \nThe three sections of the IronBucky are as follows: \n \n The Station Scramble - a short-range section visiting five stations within 40ly of Siren - well suited to fast, short range ships. \n The Bubble Tour - a mid-range section visiting five stations, each more than 100ly from Siren - well suited to long range exploration ships. \n The Wasat Rally - An SRV based section that starts and ends at Brash Dock and includes the 50km Wasat Cup SRV Course. \n Runners can attempt the three sections in whichever order they prefer, but the clock keeps running until all three sections are completed. Additionally pre-registration of your start time is required, and your actual run must begin within 15 minutes of the pre-registered time, which restricts opportunities to restart. \n \nNo ship repairs can be made, and no synthesis may be used, although SRV repairs can be made in the Wasat Rally section using ship-recall pit-stops (see below). \n \nUnlike the original Iron Bucky Trophy from the Festival of Racing, CMDRs are welcome to make as many attempts at the IronBucky as they like. However, you need to per-register a new start time each time you run, and if you fail to log a complete an IronBucky run, then you must complete the DNF log form before make a fresh attempt. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n ENTRY CLASSES \n \nRace classes are  Open Unlimited  and  Cobra Classic . \n \nEntries in Open Unlimited class may be in any type of ship, and may be engineer-modified. \n \nRather than the traditional regulation class the Lonnegan brothers prefer to allow you to outfit as you wish, within the limitations of the Cobra design. Entries in Cobra Classic class may be either Cobra Mk IIIs or Cobra Mk IVs, no engineer-modifications or xeno-tech are permitted. \n \n Open Unlimited Class Rules \nYou may enter any ship class. If entering the Ironbucky Trophy, you have the option to enter two ships. \nEngineer mods are permitted. \nTech Broker mods including Guardian tech are permitted. \nThe use of jumponium synthesis is not allowed. \nThe use of neutron star or white dwarf FSD boosting is allowed. \nThe following modules are not permitted, and must not be fitted: \n \n Docking Computer \n Supercruise Assist \n Hull Repair Limpet Controller \n Despite the name, you may compete in open-unlimited class in any game mode (open / PG / solo). Most of the BRC race in open mode though, so playing in open gives you the best chance to bump into other racers on the course, or to be cheered on during your attempt.  \n \n Cobra Classic Class Rules \nYou may enter in either a Cobra Mk III or a Cobra Mk IV \nEngineer mods, Tech Broker mods (including Guardian tech), jumponium synthesis and NS / WD FSD boosting are not allowed. \nThe following modules are not permitted, and must not be fitted: \n \n Docking Computer \n Supercruise Assist \n Hull Repair Limpet Controller \n Note: For those without access to the Mk IV, it is a bigger, heavier version of the Mk III, with more internal slots and hardpoints, but the same drives. So it's inferior to the Mk III for most Buckyball activities. \n \n \n THE STAGES \n \n \nYou may complete these three stages in whichever order you prefer, but remember  the clock doesn't stop . Once you begin your first stage the clock continues to run until you have completed all three stages. \n \n The Station Scramble \n \n Start docked at  Brash Dock  in the  Siren System \n Dock at each the following five stations in any order: \n Gauss Terminal [OU Geminorum] \n Harrison Terminal [LP 254-26] \n Ehrlich Terminal [Pepper] \n Vittori Terminal [LHS 1914] \n Lucid Port [HIP 28774] \n \n Return to dock at  Brash Dock . \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n The Bubble Tour \n \n Start docked at  Brash Dock  in the  Siren System \n Dock at each the following five stations in any order: \n Winne Gateway [80 e Piscium] \n Greg's Legacy [LTT 4961]   Asteroid Base \n Cheranovsky City [Ngurii] \n Smeaton Port [Njikan] \n Mitzi's Den [Runo]   Asteroid Base \n \n Return to dock at  Brash Dock . \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n The Wasat Rally \n \n Start docked at  Brash Dock  in the  Siren System \n Travel 22.32ly to the Wasat System. \n Land at either  Elwood Camp  or  Ferguson Prospect  on  Wasat A 2E . \n Deploy your SRV \n Drive approx 50km to the other starport. \n Request docking permission when 5-7km from your destination and drive into the hangar that your ship lands at. \n Take off \n Return to dock at  Brash Dock . \n The entry forms allow you to submit start and finish times for your SRV section, this will use the landing screenshot at the first surface base and the screenshot when you arrive back in your ship at the second base. The current record for an IronBucky Wasat SRV run travelling from Elwood Camp to Ferguson Prospect is  11m43s  by  CMDR Tannik Seldon . \n \nSRV section times will be tracked on a single leaderboard, as there's no advantage / disadvantage to open-unlimited vs cobra classic other than possibly hangar location. \n \n \n HOW TO ENTER \n \nPlease let us know if you intend to take part, by posting your intent to race in this thread with the following: \n \n Commander name \n Ship name(s) \n Ship type(s) \n Class (Cobra Classic or Open-Unlimited) \n Standard information on how to enter a BRC race, including example screenshots, can be found on the Buckyball Racing Club website. \n \nFor this race you will need to submit either a video, or the following screenshots: \nA starting screenshot – showing your ship docked at  Brash Dock  in the Siren system. \nAn end of stage screenshot – showing your ship docked back at  Brash Dock  after competing each of your first two IronBucky stages. \nA finishing screenshot – showing your ship docked back at  Brash Dock  after competing your final IronBucky stage. \nFive screenshots showing your ship docked at each of the  five stations  visited during the Station Scramble stage. \nFive screenshots showing your ship docked at each of the  five stations  visited during the Bubble Tour stage. \nTwo screenshots showing your ship docked at  Elwood Camp  and  Ferguson Prospect  on Wasat A 2E – one before deploying your SRV and one after docking back at your ship. You may make your Wasat Rally SRV run in either direction – common consensus is that  Elwood  to  Ferguson  is faster. \n \nThe in-game time and date must be visible in each screenshot. \n \nIf submitted as screenshots, the best way to submit your evidence is as a hidden Imgur post. You can drag and drop your screenshots easily into the post and then reorder and label them as you wish. Please try to submit your screenshots in chronological order from start to finish. \n \nAs that is a total of 16 screenshots required, then I would advise you to make a video recording of your run and then extract the screenshots from your video at the end, rather than risk blowing a prefect IronBucky run by forgetting to press F10. \n \nIf you prefer to submit a video recording of your run, then please upload the recording to your preferred video streaming service – eg YouTube.  Note although I've got an in-browser VPN that I can use to try and get around YouTube's licensing rules, if I'm unable to view your evidence video due those rules and your choice of background music, then I'll need you to extract some evidence screenshots instead before adding your run to the leaderboard. \n \n \n SPECIAL RULES \n \n No Ship Repairs \nUnlike regular BRC events the IronBucky Challenge is only for hard-core maniacs. For this reason ship repairs of any kind are banned. No in station repairs, no hull seal callouts, no use of hull repair limpets. \n \n No Synthesis \nThe use of synthesis during a run is strictly banned, including refuels and repairs during the SRV section. You may repair your SRV by making SRV pitstops – see below. \n \n No Rebuys \nIf your ship is destroyed for any reason, then your IronBucky attempt has ended, rebuys are not permitted. \n \n SRV Destroyed \nIf your SRV is destroyed, then you may restart your SRV section again if you wish. You must begin again docked in your ship at either Elwood Camp or Ferguson Prospect. So if you respawn into a hovering ship then you'll need to dock again before restarting your SRV section. \n \n SRV Pitstops \nThe SRV section of the original Festival of Racing IronBucky was perhaps a little too difficult, but Tony and Nuk really don't want to allow those sneaky midair synthesis repairs. So if you're getting worried about your SRV hull damage, you may repair it by making a pitstop: \n \n Select SHIP RECALL from your SRV lower display panel. \n Chase your ship as it lands nearby. \n Dock with your ship, this will automatic repair your SRV hull to 100% \n Deploy your SRV again. \n Continue your SRV section. \n Please keep a count of how many SRV Pitstops you make during your attempt – the submission form will ask you at the end. \nYou can expect to lose around minute making a pitstop, not counting the time it will take to get back into a rhythm and up to speed with your  \" flyving. \"  So bear in mind that the fastest SRV section times will likely be made by CMDRs who can complete a run without needing to stop for repairs. \n \n Mandatory Pre-registration \nUnlike most BRC events, it is mandatory to pre-register your run,  using this form . \nOnce you pre-register you are free to begin your run at your specified start time, or any time up to 15 minutes later than your specified time. You are free to select any time, including the current time as your specified start time. Your start time uses in-game time (ie UTC). \n \n Mandatory DNF (did not finish) logging.  \nOnce you pre-register that you are making a run, you must either submit evidence of a completed run, or log your failed run as a DNF  using this form . You may make as may IronBucky attempts as you wish, but each attempt must be pre-registered and then either completed or logged as DNF. Little Nuk wants to know about every explosion, every screw-up and every rage-quit -  cus' he's a sociopathic little sadist who loves to hear about your pain. \n \nThe intention of the Pre-registration and DNF logging is to give each IronBucky attempt a one-shot feeling, so you can abandon your attempts, but can't jump straight back to the beginning without submitting the details. \n \n \n Thinking of making a run? Fancy some advice? Why not join us in the BRC Discord? \n \n ​ \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler:  But I liked the smuggling race! \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So is it really true? Fat Tony and Little Nuk have gone legit? No more Black Riband? \nThat really sucks! I was planning to try the Black Riband really soon, and now it's gone forever! \n \nOkay, so Tony and Nuk were thinking that they'll never actually go 100% legit. \nAnd they really do like hosting a smuggling challenge, but maybe they should keep things a little more hush, hush – and a LOT less complex this time! \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \nThe Black Riband Returns will launch (quite) soon – the above banner is a placeholder. If you want to discuss this event in the IronBucky thread please use spoiler tags – remember it's all hush, hush. If you want to chat about it without spoiler tags feel free on the BRC Discord. \n \n This new challenge is almost ready to launch now.  The event is relatively simple, so the rules will be fairly short. As a heads-up, the easiest way to participate will involve meeting up in-game, in open-mode, with  CMDR 'Fat Tony' Lonnigan  before making a run, and the smallest ship (in terms of optional-internal slots) that can participate is the  Diamondback Explorer,  because a 48t cargo hold is required.  A few ships such as both Vipers, the DBX, the iCourier and the Hauler are too small to enter.   Apologies to small-ship fans, the Cobra Mk III and DBX will certainly manage the new race though. \n \nOnce the race is completely ready (which mostly involves me getting Fat Tony ready, as the format is set), I'll make an initial test run with Fat Tony (to get my name on the boards in true ElectricZ style). Then I'll invite current Black Riband holder Bruski to challenge Fat Tony's time - I guarantee he'll beat it so long as he tries - then the Black Riband Returns will be open to all.  \n \nThe event will be open to platforms, as meeting Fat Tony in game isn't strictly necessary - although it is be the coolest and easiest way to participate. \n \n Basically -  SPOILER within a SPOILER Warning!  - racers will need to start the race with 48t of  stolen  low temperature diamonds in their cargo hold. On PC you'll be able to meet up with Fat Tony in a quiet corner of the bubble and he'll give you the stolen diamonds (he's a mobster so he can get hold of them easily). \nPC Racers can optionally steal their own diamonds to participate if they like, you can acquire the stolen diamonds any way you like, so long as you start the race loaded with 48t. Console players who wish to participate will need to provide their own stolen diamonds, at least until FD decide to make the game truly cross platform - once console players are able to instance with PC players, they'll be able meet up with Fat Tony too  \n\t\t \n\t \n

Click here for past race results. \n \n ​ \n \n \n The  \" Buckyball \"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash,  widely known simply as  The Buckyball Run ,  was an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system,  intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n \n Oh no, not this again. \n \nC'mon don't be like that. You haven't even read the details yet! Don't be a don't-bee! Be a do-bee! \n \n Fine. Tell me more. \n \nThe Buckyball Run is a series of point-to-point rally races through the space lanes of Elite Dangerous where pilots record their best time from start to finish. Commanders can make a run in whatever vessel they have provided it has the jump range. Sidewinders and Haulers all the way up to fully tricked out Anacondas have all made a run. But the Buckyball isn't just about coming in first, it's about taking the dare. It's putting all your piloting skills to use: navigation, supercruise navigation, power management docking, to see how far you can push your ship and make it to the finish line in one piece (or as close as you can manage.) \n \n Okay, so you've had short races, multi-station scrambles and a jaunt to the center of the galaxy. What are you doing now? And why Buckyball Run  \" X \" ? \n \nWhy  \" X \" ? Because we've had 10, count 'em, ten Buckyball Runs since 3300. We had to honor this auspicious occasion somehow. Rather than institute a black tie dress code it was easier to get all fancy and use a Roman numeral. Besides, I hate ties. \n \nAs for the race itself, Buckyball Run X is a  \" scramble, \"  racing to reach four checkpoints before returning to the starting line as quickly as possible in whatever ship you choose by whatever route you choose.  Anything else goes; extra fuel tanks, FSD injection, fuel scoops, dirty drives, clean drives, fuzzy dice, what have you.  \n \nThis time around we're having two courses.  \" Big X \"  for long range ships, and the  \" little x \"  for our shorter range competitors. You can run in either one, or both. Open or solo/private. Take your pick. Shoot video or take screenshots at the checkpoints to validate your time and submit them to be included on The Big Board. \n \nAs usual, I've drawn up a map. I recommend that you follow my lead put it somewhere easy to see when flying. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n BIG X: \n Start: VZ Corvi, docked at Ashton Gateway \nDock at four checkpoints in any order: \n \n I Carinae, Somerset Station \n HDS 1065, Furukawa Terminal \n HIP 71515, Velho Dock \n Faust 3566, Collins Dock \n Finish: back at VZ Corvi, docked at Ashton Gateway ​ \n little x \n Start: VZ Corvi, docked at Ashton Gateway \nDock at four checkpoints in any order: (well, three dockings really) \n \n Wolf 1060, Pawelczyk Hangar \n Veneri, Al-Khayyam Hub \n BD-17 3725 (no station - take screenshot of forward view with clock before you jump to your next stop) \n Eta Corvi, Henslow City \n Finish: back at VZ Corvi, docked at Ashton Gateway ​ \nYou can fly any ship you like on either course, except large ships won't fit in  little x .  little x  has platforms. That also means medium ships may run into pad congestion. Also note that in BD-17 3725 there is no dock. Just take a screenshot out the front window showing the brand new dash clock and jump to your next destination. \n \nRun as many times as you like in any category you like, then hit the SUBMIT TIME button in this thread to record your pertinent information. Easy, peasy. \n \n OK I think I got it. But let's get down to brass tacks. What do I get if I win? What do I get for doing any of this? \n \nNothing really. It's just for fun and bragging rights. \n \n Wait... what? Seriously? I could lose my ship. I could be doing long distance runs. I could get interdicted a million times. And after doing all of this I get nothing? \n \nYeah pretty much. You DO get a dot next to your name on the Big Board. \n \n So this will actually cost me time and money. \n \nIt sure will! Possibly a LOT of both, really. It's kinda up to you how much. \n \n This sounds like a complete waste of time. \n \nAin't that the truth? Listen, save yourself. Close this browser window right now. It's the only logical thing to do. \n \n Forget that guy, this sounds like a blast! \n \nThat's the spirit! It is a metric crapton of fun. We wouldn't be up to our tenth race now if it weren't. \n \nAnd I lied about not winning anything. After you complete just one Buckyball Run, you'll never fly the same again. Every trade run, every smuggling mission, every time you dock will become a race against the clock. If you think you can get from point A to point B fast now, you'll be amazed at how much time you chop off the clock once you get the technique down. That's a gift that keeps on giving. Not to mention linking up with some pretty awesome CMDRs. Oh, and you get a (virtual) bumper sticker for your ship. Everybody loves bumper stickers. \n \nPlus it's just a lot of fun. You like fun, don't you? \n \n Man, I LIVE for fun. So all ships compete together? Do I need Horizons for this? \n \nYes, all ships compete together, and no you don't need Horizons. However, spaceship modding is a fact of life now regardless of your version number, so if you don't have access to engineers, you will find yourself going up against modded ships. Don't let that shake you. Some pilots gen up perfectly race spec'd ships, others fly their fully outfitted regular ride to see what their machine can do. Sure, you won't take first from an Anaconda flying a Cobra, but you can compare your times to your fellow Cobra pilots or other classes to see where you stand. More importantly, you get to know your favorite ship that much better.  \n \nBUT, for racers who want to remove ship stats, modding and money in the spirit of pure competition, there is always... \n \n The Hauler Challenge ​ To give pilots a chance to test their navigation and docking skills against other pilots instead of their bank accounts and engineering connections, we have the  Hauler Challenge.  Buy a hauler, fit it to the following  \" regulation \"  specs and take it out on the Big X Course. Note that Hauler Challenge is Open only. No mods allowed, no FSD boosting or in-flight refueling. Everybody flies the same ship. Winning the HCX comes down to planning and piloting, period. \n \n Regulation Hauler at Coriolis.io \n \n How long does this take? \n \nGive yourself 20-30 minutes to complete this run, depending on your jump range. But I'm sure some ace pilot will finish it in ten. There's always someone out there wrecking the curve... \n \n How do I upload screenshots? \n \nUse F10 in game or F12 in Steam to take the screenshot, then use a free image hosting service like  www.imgur.com  to store them, then send the URL to your screenshot album/video with your entry. (If you make it an album it goes much easier.) \n \n NOTE:  Pilots recording video of the race do not need to take screenshots provided the recording shows the clock at takeoff and landing at each checkpoint as well as the Outfitting screen as outlined above. \n \n ANOTHER NOTE:  If your video is going to take days to convert and post, don't worry about it. Grab a screenshot of outfitting, your takeoff time and landing time at Ashton Gateway and send the links for them instead. That'll be good enough to get on the board. You will still be expected to provide the full video at the end of the race, though, or get the dreaded DQ. (cue dramatic music.) \n \n ANOTHER NOTE:  We've got a spiffy form for submitting race entries. If for some reason you can't or don't want to use an image hosting service, enter  \" Http://attachment.com \"  on the entry form and then email Bucky the screenshots as an attachment to bucky AT electricz dot net. \n \nThe deadline to submit times is 23:59 game time, Saturday, 25 June, 3302. You make as many attempts as you like. Open play and Solo/Private times will be logged separately. Please note open or solo play when submitting your times. \n \n \n \n The Important Stuff (How to register and race) ​ \n Post your intent to race in this thread, or if you are not a forum member, email  (bucky at electricz dot net)  with your info. List the following: \n Your commander's name (if different than your user name) \n Ship Name \n Ship Type and race class (BIG X,  little x , or Hauler, Open or Solo/Private) \n Your answer for the Official Buckyball Question of the Race:  \" What is the most dangerous lifeform out there? \"  It could be an alien, a monster, your ex, that science project growing in the back of the fridge in the Fuel Rat breakroom in Fuelum... Forget thargoids. What being should we  really  fear?  \n \n Make sure your ship is in tip-top shape at  Ashton Gateway in the VZ Corvi system.  Make repairs, remove any excess mass, get it configured how you want it for the race. \n Open the Outfitting screen and switch to the  \" Core Internal \"  screen and take a screenshot, or start video . Be sure to capture Power Plant, Thruster, FSD and Distributor statistics along with your jump range. \n Make sure you are on the surface and prepare for launch. If you start your clock in the hangar you'll be unhappy. \n Take a screenshot showing your location and time. You need it in order to qualify your run. \n Launch and get going, champ! The clock is ticking! \n Navigate to the four checkpoints in your race course (BIG X or  little x ) in any order. \n At each checkpoint, dock and take your screenshot showing your arrival time on the dash clock. NOTE: BD-17 3725 in  little x  has no station for docking. Just take your screenshot in open space, then move on. \n Return to  Ashton Gateway in the VZ Corvi system.  and take your final screenshot right as you dock. \n Upload your screenshots to a free hosting service like Imgur.com and copy the link to the album containing your screenshots. \n Use the Buckyball Run racing form to submit your info. (It's spiffy!)  Click here for the form.   Please do not post your race results in the thread.  If you don't have an image host, fill out the form and use  http://attachment.com  as the location and PM me your attachments. Thanks! - Bucky \n ​ \n Kick back on the  Shotgun Shine , relax, have a drink or two (Bucky makes a mean martini!) and share tales of your race with your fellow Buckyballers for them to admire or ridicule as they see fit. Or, if you think you can do better, head on back out! You're already at the starting line. Why wouldn't you? \n \nSubmissions for race times will be accepted until 23:59 game time, Saturday, 25 June, 3302.  If you are not a member of the forum and would like to participate anyway, email your intent to race to  (bucky at electricz dot net.) \n \n Sounds doable. Anything else? \n \nWe try to keep things informal and friendly. You can run as many times as you like, and your best time will be recorded for each class. When the race period is over, I will post the collected times and a summary of the race, and pilots can share their screenshots, videos, routes and tactics with the world. \n \n So what's to keep me from faking my screenshots or lying about my ship's configuration? \n \nI can't stop you. Not at all. There are all kinds of ways you can cheat on this. But in the real life, earth-bound Cannonball Run the competitors were racing just for the fun of it. There was a  \" gentlemen's agreement that the vehicle entered would be driven the entire distance, not having it transported on another vehicle, nor having an identical second vehicle hidden near the finish, etc. \"  That's the spirit of this little exercise. How fast can you make the run, using only your piloting skills the ship you've got? There's no need to cheat because what would that get you? There's no prize other than doing it. Besides, cheaters make Bucky sad. Do you want to make Bucky sad? Don't be that commander. Nobody likes that commander.   \n \n Thanks for the lecture. Anything else? \n \nNope, that about does it. \n \nLadies and gentlemen, start your engines. You may launch at any time. The  Shotgun Shine  is already docked at Ashton Gateway. As usual, Fuel Rats drink free. Good luck, Commanders!

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nSo this was originally slated to jump off in October, but thanks to Obsidian Orbital's lengthy construction time, mysterious station malfunctions, the GalMap Route Plot Mutiny of 3301,  and the general instability of the space-time continuum of late, Buckyball 9 has been on the back burner. But it looks like that's all changed. We have a finish line, and a way to get there. Let's get this show on the road. \n \n Note to regular racers!  This is not the registration thread, but rather a  \" save the date \"  notification so pilots wanting to participate know to be in/around the bubble before the race starts. The official registration thread will go up the day before with the specifics of the race (like, the starting line.) \n \nThis is also to announce the first LIVE Buckyball, where runners will launch at the same time and scramble to reach Obsidian as quickly as they can. More on that below. \n \n Wait, I'm new here. What's this again? \n \nIt's the Buckyball Run, chum! A bunch of pilots getting together to see how fast they can fly and how high they can make their insurance premiums go.  \n \n Isn't that what Elite Racers do? \n \nThe Elite Racers are kindred spirits, but they keep their action up close and personal, flying in and around space ports. Buckyballers fly rally races throughout the bubble,  and sometimes across the galaxy.  Think you're fast? CMDR Alot holds the record to Sagittarius A* at 8 hours, 7 minutes and 58 seconds. Maybe you can beat him. \n \n That's insane. \n \nTell me about it. Alot and some of the other pilots have done it multiple times. Between you and me, they're nuts. I can judge them because I only did it once. \n \n So you're racing across the galaxy again? \n \nNah, this is a local race but will be in the neighborhood of 500 light years. Again, the details will come in the registration thread.  \n \n So... How does this work, exactly? \n \nBuckyball Runs are asymmetric races. They run for about a week. Participating CMDRs follow the race route and document their times with screenshots of the ship's dash clock or video, and then at the end of the race the times are compared to declare a winner. \n \n Sounds interesting. What do I get if I win? \n \nNothing really. It's just for fun and bragging rights. \n \n Seriously? \n \nYep. \n \n So this will actually cost me time and money. \n \nPretty much. Possibly a LOT of both, really. \n \n You lost me. \n \nEh. Happens a lot. You might as well save yourself the heartache now and click that big red X in the corner to close this window. Do it now,  before it's too late! \n \n Forget that guy, this sounds like a blast! \n \nThat's the spirit! It is a metric crapton of fun. We couldn't keep doing it going into our third year otherwise.  Click here to see the previous races. \n \nAnd I lied about not winning anything. Once you complete your first Buckyball, you'll never fly the same again. Every trade run, every smuggling mission, every docking will become a race to you. If you think you can get from point A to point B fast now, you'll be amazed at how much time you chop off the clock once you get the technique down. That's a gift that keeps on giving. Not to mention linking up with some pretty awesome CMDRs.  \n \nPlus it's just a lot of fun. You like fun, don't you? \n \n Man, I LIVE for fun. So what about this  \" live \"  race? This is new? \n \nOh yeah! So, like I said before ordinarily Buckyball is asymmetric. CMDRs launch and run the race on their own schedules and can keep running the race until they get an optimum time. This time, though, we're gonna try to do a live launch right at the start. Prior to 2100 GMT on 2 January, anyone who wants to can gather at the starting line (location TBD) in whatever ship they like and when 2100 rolls around launch at once. Whoever reaches Obsidian Orbital first is the winner of the live event. Officially, the race winner will be determined at the end of the week as usual, but like everything else we do, the live run is just for the fun of it.  \n \nNote that this is not a combat event - it's a race not a deathmatch. Regardless, make sure your insurance is paid up. While it's not combat racing, it can be a bit of a demolition derby in the slot... \n \n Got it. So, official race registration begins January 1st, the race starts January 2nd, with a live event kicking off at 2100 GMT in any ship I want. \n \nYup, that's it, with the rest of the week being run like a traditional Buckyball. For a better idea of what that looks like, have a look at the Buckyball Run 7 thread: \n \n ​ \nOr better still, slide into your flight suit, grab your helmet and head off for the Buckyball Racing Club's current event, running NOW! \n \n \n ​ \nHope to see you on the starting grid! Got questions, just ask. Someone will have an answer.

Click here for the Buckyblog. \n \n ​ \n The  \" Buckyball \"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash,  widely known simply as  The Buckyball Run ,  was an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system,  intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n So what is it? \n \nThe Buckyball Run is the name of a series of point-to-point rally races through the space lanes of Elite Dangerous where pilots record their best time from start to finish. Commanders can make the run in whatever vessel they have provided it has the jump range. The Buckyball Run isn't just about coming in first, it's about taking the dare. Sidewinders and Haulers all the way up to fully tricked out Anacondas have all made the Run. \n \n I thought Buckyballs were numbered. Like Buckyball 5, 6, 7... What's with Buckyball A? And why the asterisk? \n \n The Buckyball Run A*  is a little different than previous Buckyballs. The A* is a reference to the finish line. Sagittarius A*. As such, it's not a numbered race like the others. \n \n Sagittarius A*? As in the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way galaxy? THAT Sagittarius A*? \n \nYep, that's the one! The only other Sagittarius A* I know of is this crappy nightclub at George Lucas in Leesti. They water their drinks and charge a .10cr cover. No way in hell we're going there on a run. \n \n That's almost 26,000 light years!!! \n \n View attachment 30394 \n \nGive or take. \n \n That'll take forever!!! \n \nOr 12 hours, 58 minutes. You see, there's  this commander named Anuranium who showed up for Buckyball 7, ran once, kinda shrugged as if to say  \" that's cute, \"  took his bumper sticker and left. Little did we know the week before he had just come back from his own private run. He'd posted a picture of his clock at Galileo Station in Sol,then posted a picture of himself at Sagittarius A* about 13 hours later. \n \nNeedless to say we at the Buckyball Run were impressed. An endurance race has always been in the cards and Sag A* was already on the short list. Anuranium just went and did the legwork for us. So really, Buckyball Run A* can stand for Buckyball Run Anuranium as well, or the Anuranium Run, since he actually went out there for no other reason than to see how fast it could be done. And that, ladies and gents, is what the Buckyball is all about. Well, that and huge bar tabs. \n \nCongrats on your epic run, CMDR Anuranium. Bucky salutes you! o7 The only question now is can anyone beat you? \n \n IMPORTANT NOTE:  CMDR Anuranium pulled off this non-stop feat of derring-do in a tricked out Anaconda with a long jump range and ginormous fuel scoop. Smaller ships will have to make more jumps and spend a lot more time scooping to make the trip. Get that 13 hour time out of your head unless you're in a similar ship. The jaunt to Sag A* might take you considerably longer, even several days and that's cool. Just be ready for the long haul. \n \n Is this like previous runs where I can choose Solo or Open? \n \nUnfortunately not. Anuranium set the bar by making the trip in Open, and splitting the leaderboards by open/solo like was done in the past will dilute the results. It also sounds like work. Bucky doesn't like extra work. So open only, no solo/private groups accepted. Sorry. \n \n Ok so then you're only counting time logged in the game, right? If I go to sleep or go have to go to work or take care of my family, the timer stops, right? And picks up when I come back in? \n \nNope. Time waits for no one. The clock starts when you launch, and stops only when you reach Sagittarius A*. Any time asleep, at work, in the can, whatever, all count towards your total time. That doesn't mean you can't take breaks or even go to sleep if you like, but it all definitely counts against your time. \n \n You're on onionhead. This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You expect people to sit in their cockpits, ignoring all else for an entire day making a thousand jumps and fuel scooping over and over all while trying not to fall asleep to crash exiting hyperspace or make a mistake while navigating and end up in a patch of unscoopable stars to make a speedrun to the center of the galaxy??? \n \nNobody's holding a railgun to your head. The line leading to the ordinary is right over there. They saved a spot for ya. \n \n Psh... Forget that greenhorn. I'm in! But what do I get out of this if I do it? \n \nYou get to sit in your cockpit ignoring all else for an entire day making a thousand jumps and fuel scooping over and over all while trying not to fall asleep to crash exiting hyperspace or make a mistake while navigating and end up in a patch of unscoopable stars to make a speedrun to the center of the galaxy. Sounds like fun, doesn't it? \n \nBut... in addition to having your time officially recorded, you get the chance to have your name forever stenciled in history as the discoverer of a new system. Take a discovery scanner, and rake in millions selling cartographic data upon your return. Achieve Elite status as an explorer. If you're any type of romantic, you get to make an epic trip to the center of our galaxy and see that bright band of stars from the inside looking out, to know what it's like to be at the middle a giant whirlpool of stars a hundred thousand light years across. You get to encounter the largest black hole ever recorded, the cosmic drain around which the Milky Way swirls and have, for a brief moment, the entire galaxy centered around  you. \n \nIf  that's  not enough, you also get a free bumper sticker. \n \n Sweet! Everybody loves bumper stickers! \n \nI know, right? Plus, if you're a regular Buckyballer, in addition to the regular dots awarded, you'll have a spiffy looking star next to your name as well. Pretty badass, huh? \n \n Thumbs up! Let's do this! What's the drill? \n \nI took the liberty of drawing a route map. I hope you find it helpful: \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nDock at Galileo in Sol. Or, if you haven't sufficiently bootlicked your way up the Federal ranks or you just can't stand being in Fed space, you can start at Lomas Orbital at Wolf 359. It's a little further away but it shouldn't make a difference. (Anybody who whines about this starts at Hutton Oribital at Alpha Centauri. Anybody going to whine? Didn't think so.) Exit the station, hang a left or right depending on your vector, fly 25,800-ish light years to Sagittarius A* as fast as you can. Easy! But there are some specifics for it to count: \n \n \n The Important Stuff (How to register and race) ​ \n \n Post your intent to race in this thread, or if you are not a forum member, email  (bucky at electricz dot net) with your info. List the following: \n Your commander's name (if different than your user name) \n Ship Name \n Ship Type \n \n When you're ready to start, begin a game session in Open Mode. (No Solo or Private Group runs.) \n Make sure your ship is in tip-top shape at  Galileo in Sol, or Lomas Orbiter in Wolf 359.  Make repairs, remove any excess mass, get it configured how you want it for the run, because it's gonna be a long trip back if you forget your sunglasses. \n Open the Outfitting screen and hit F10 for a screenshot of your ship. Be sure to capture Power Plant, Thruster, FSD and Distributor statistics as well as your ship's mass. You will send this with your race time submission. \n Make sure you are on the surface and prepare for launch. If you start your clock in the hangar you'll be unhappy. \n Hit F10 to take a screenshot or start your video capture, showing your location and time. You need it in order to qualify your run. \n Launch and get going, champ! The clock is ticking! \n Navigate your way to Sagittarius A*. Spoiler alert: it's far. \n Upon arrival at Sag A* bring your engine to a halt, fire up your galmap and take a screenshot of your position and the chronometer. Congratulations, you made it! You might want to alt-tab out and check your screenshot folder to make sure it actually got taken taken. \n PM me links to your screenshots, three total: your outfitting screen, start time on the dock, gal map showing end time and location at Sag A*. Feel free to post supporting evidence, your Sag A* Selfies, etc, in the thread. In fact, take a few for insurance purposes, in case you are called out by another racer. \n With your screenshots, include the following information: \n Your Commander's Name \n Your Ship's Name \n Your total race Time. Use a site like Time Duration Calculator for easy calculation. Please include your time because I guarantee I will mess it up and you will be unhappy. \n A short quote (40-50 chars) upon reaching the finish line! It can be anything you like. Something inspirational. A dedication to someone. Just keep it clean and your words will go down in history. \n PM me your real-world, earthbound mailing address and you'll receive an official real-world Buckyball Run A* bumper sticker at no cost to you! You earned it, sport! \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n (while supplies last. One per CMDR. Offer applies only for BBRA* and not any other Buckyball event.) ​ \n \n Head back with your head held high by whatever route and at your own pace. You're a galactic hero! Your name and time will go on the leaderboard with the next update. \n \nCMDRs who make the trip will have their times posted on a leaderboard by time. But in addition to the main leaderboard for all times, but there will be a separate board for the top time in each ship class. So fly what you want, or what you have. Take an Orca. Take a Viper. Shoot, one CMDR circumnavigated the entire galaxy in a Sidewinder. Be the first to do it in an Eagle, or a Hauler. Just getting on the board is an achievement. \n \nAs usual, screenshots will verify the racers' times. Screenshot your clock before launch and of the galmap at upon arrival for your run to count. CMDRs recording video can still do so if they have the terabytes to do it, but you still have to send me the screenshots. You can take screenshots from the recorded video after the fact. Important note: we're on the honor system here, but events may arise requiring you to send the actual .bmp files from your screenshot directory. If you can't produce them if asked by the racing staff to do so, you may face disqualification. So don't modify the originals, and keep them in a safe place! \n \n Crap. I've already been to Sag A*. But I really want that bumper sticker. \n \nYou can always go back again for time. For a while we were taking down names of visitors on an  \" unofficial \"  list, but that's really just duplicating the fine efforts of Kancro Vantas's excellent and much more comprehensive  Sagittarius A* Visitor's list.  Head on over there if you haven't already and get on the list. \n \n Just so you know, astronomers abbreviate Sagittarius A* as  \" Sgr A* \" \n \nOh who invited you back to the conversation? Anybody who knows Sagittarius A* personally calls him  \" Sadge. \"  Only people who peep through telescopes from 26,000 light years away call him  \" Sgr. \"  Perverts. \n \n So What's to keep me from faking my screenshots or lying about my ship's configuration? \n \nI can't stop you. Not at all. There are all kinds of ways you can cheat on this. Faking screenshots, using exploits. Note that even using the Wingman Nav Lock function, even though it is built in to the game, should be avoided. Iin the real life, earth-bound Cannonball Run, there was  \" a gentlemen's agreement that the vehicle entered would be driven the entire distance, not having it transported on another vehicle, nor having an identical second vehicle hidden near the finish, etc. \"   That's the spirit of this little exercise. How fast can you make the run, using only your piloting skills the ship you've got? There's no need to cheat because what would that get you? There's no prize other than doing it. The competitors did it just for the hell of it. Besides, cheaters make Bucky sad. Do you want to make Bucky sad? Don't be that commander. Nobody likes that commander.  \n \n Thanks for the lecture. Anything else? \n \nNope, that about does it. If you have any questions at all, either post them here or PM me before you take off. You don't want to get all the way out there and  then  ask. The rules may be amended or changed as time goes on but I will do everything I can to keep the core challenge the same. \n \nAnd finally, the  Shotgun Shine  won't be waiting at the end of this run, but CMDR Ortilano says that anybody returning with a Sag A* asterisk next to their name gets the steak gaucho dinner plate (or a meal of the racer's choice) on the house and their picture behind the bar. \n \n Wait, what about Buckyball Run 8? \n \nIt was originally planned to kick off 18 Jul but BBR8 is on hold until further notice.  \n \nLadies and gentlemen, start your engines! You may launch at any time.

Click here for the Buckyblog. \n \n ​ \n The  \" Buckyball \"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash,  widely known simply as  The Buckyball Run ,  was an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system,  intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n So what is it? \n \nThe Buckyball Run is the name of a series of point-to-point rally races through the space lanes of Elite Dangerous where pilots record their best time from start to finish. Commanders can make the run in whatever vessel they have provided it has the jump range. The Buckyball Run isn't just about coming in first, it's about taking the dare. Sidewinders and Haulers all the way up to fully tricked out Anacondas have all made the Run. \n \n So... What are we doing this time? \n \n The Buckyball Run 7  is a  \" Scramble \"  race. Instead of a long route stretching across hundreds of light years, pilots will have to dock at seven stations of their choosing in seven closely spaced systems before return to the starting point. Because this might be more confusing than previous events, I took the liberty of drawing a map: \n \n ​ \n (Click the map for a more readable version. - Mirana) \n \n What the hell kind of map is that?!? \n \nWhat are you, an art critic? Who died and made you Magellan? It's perfectly legible! Racers will launch from Cady City in No Chianga, and then hit any seven out of the eleven stations on the map in any order.  Cady City does not count as one of the seven checkpoints.  Basically pick 7 out of 11, then come home to Cady. Only dock at the listed stations. Take a screen shot of your dash clock at each stop, then another when you land back at Cady. Note all the checkpoints are full-size stations. No platforms. We don't discriminate against ships with big bones The pilot with the best time will be declared the winner! \n \n This is as clear as mud. \n \nStart at Cady city in No Chianga. Take a snapshot of your dash clock to mark your starting time. \n \n Got it. \n \nPick any 7 of the 11 stations to visit. Take a snapshot of your dashclock as you dock at each one to prove you were there. \n \n Got it. \n \nCome back to Cady. Take another snap of your dashclock to mark your finish time. \n \n Got it. Do I have to visit every system? \n \nNope. It's the stations that count. You need 7 out of the 11 listed. It's part of the theme. Buckyball 7. Get it? \n \n Yeah, 7. Clever. And Cady City doesn't count toward the 7?  \n \nNope. Cady is not a checkpoint, it's the finish line. \n \n Why didn't you just say so? \n \nI thought I did. But I was drunk when I drew up the map. Maybe you need to be drunk to read it. \n \n So all ships compete together? \n \nYep. Ship modding has made classes irrelevant, and we still haven't been able to figure a way to segregate racers by ship class, FSD type, cost and hull color without a whole lot of rules. Rules mean work and since Bucky does all the work around here I do my best to lighten the load for him. So we keep it as simple as possible. The race will be run in two classes, and each can be run Multiplayer or Solo. First we have Unlimited, where you can race whatever you have, from a Sidewinder up to an Anaconda, configured however you like, and for racers who want to remove ship stats and money from the competition, there is always... \n \n The Sidewinder Challenge ​ To give pilots a chance to test their skills against other pilots instead of their bank accounts, we have Sidewinder Challenge. With multiple ship ownership, this is a lot easier than back when you had to sell your baby to race a Sidey. It works like this: at Cady City, purchase a stock Sidewinder. (Talk to Larenz Giler down at AAAA Ships 'N' Service. He'll make you a good deal. Mention the Buckyball and get 10% off of a hull wash and detailing) Fit your stock Sidey with an A2 FSD and A2 Thrusters. (EDIT: Cady appears not to be stocking A2 FSD's. Slide over to Ray Port in Shesmu. They've got them there. Thanks for nothing, Larenz!) The whole package will run you about 250-300K. Strip out the loaner pulse lasers to increase jump range. After that you can't change, remove, or add any other component. That means no fuel scoop, no other downgrades to remove mass, or anything else. You have to dock in order to refuel. (in this race it shouldn't be an issue) The purpose of this race is to put all your piloting skills to use: navigation, supercruise management, docking, the works. May the best pilot win. \n \nHere's what your Regulation Sidewinder should look like at launch: \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \nIf you've got a Sidewinder but don't want to follow these restrictions you can of course run it in the Unlimited class. It'd be cool to see exactly what a tricked out Sidey is capable of. \n \n How long does this take? \n \nGive yourself 25-40 minutes to complete this run. \n \n Anything else? \n \nScreenshots will verify the racers' times. Take one before you launch and one each as you land at each of the seven checkpoints. The difference between the time you launch at Cady and when you return will be your time for the race. You will also need to provide a screenshot of your vessel in the Outfitting screen showing the internal configuration and performance stats. \n \n That's, like, 10 whole screenshots. \n \nRelax. The computer does all the work for you. \n \n NOTE:  if you intend to do more than one run, just send your start/stop screenshots from Cady. When you are satisfied with your time and don't want to make any more attempts, send me all the links to your pictures. That way you obsessive types don't have to spend all day uploading your shots. Do note that if I post a time for you and you can't provide the screenshots by the end of the race, it's an automatic DQ. (cue dramatic music) To date, I'm the only Buckyballer ever to be disgraced with a DQ. Don't be like me. \n \n ANOTHER NOTE:  Pilots recording video of the race do not need to take screenshots provided the recording shows the clock at takeoff and landing at each checkpoint as well as the Outfitting screen as outlined above.  YETANOTHER NOTE:  If your video is going to take days to convert and post, don't worry about it. Grab a screenshot of outfitting, your takeoff time and landing time at Cady and send that instead. That'll be good enough to get on the board. You will still be expected to provide the full video at the end of the race, though, or get the dreaded DQ. (cue dramatic music.) \n \nThe deadline to submit times is 23:59 game time, Saturday, 11 April 3301. You make as many attempts as you like. Open play and Solo times will be logged separately. Please note open or solo play when submitting your times. \n \nSo, to participate in the Buckyball Run 7: \n \n The Important Stuff (How to register and race) ​ \n Post your intent to race in this thread, or if you are not a forum member, email  (bucky at electricz dot net)  with your info. List the following: \n Your commander's name (if different than your user name) \n Ship Name \n Ship Type \n Your answer for the Official Buckyball Question of the Race:  \" Who is your favorite Artificial Intelligence? Computer, robot, or whatever? \" \n \n Make sure your ship is in tip-top shape at  Cady City in the No Chianga system.  Make repairs, remove any excess mass, get it configured how you want it for the race. You should have at least 10ly jump range to make this Run. \n Open the Outfitting screen and hit F10 for a screenshot of your ship. Be sure to capture Power Plant, Thruster, FSD and Distributor statistics. You will send this with your race time submission. \n Make sure you are on the surface and prepare for launch. If you start your clock in the hangar you'll be unhappy. \n Hit F10 to take a screenshot or start your video capture, showing your location and time. You need it in order to qualify your run. \n Launch and get going, champ! The clock is ticking! \n Navigate your way to and dock any 7 stations on the map in any order. No other stations count.  Cady City does not count as one of the seven checkpoints. \n  At each checkpoint, hit F10 to screenshot as soon as your dash clock comes up, showing your time and location. \n Return to the finish line by docking at  Cady City in the No Chianga system,  the station you started from. Don't forget to take that last screenshot of your finishing time. \n PM me links to your screenshots. If you are going to make another attempt, just the first and last screenshots at Cady will do. For your final run, send links to all 10: your ship's configuration, start/stop at No Chianga, and the seven checkpoints. Don't post them in this thread. If you recorded video, send me the link. \n With your screenshots/video, include the following information: \n Your Ship Name \n Game Mode: Open or Solo/Private \n Your Race Time.   Use Time Duration Calculator  for easy calculation. Please include your time because I guarantee I will mess it up and you will be sad. \n \n Sit back, relax, have a drink or two (Bucky makes a mean martini!) and share tales of your race with your fellow Buckyballers for them to admire or ridicule as they see fit. Or, if you think you can do better, head on back out! You're already at the starting line. Why wouldn't you? \n \nSubmissions for race times will be accepted until 23:59 game time, Saturday, 11 April, 3301.  If you are not a member of the forum and would like to participate anyway, email your links and route info to  (bucky at electricz dot net.) \n \n Sounds doable. Anything else? \n \nWe try to keep things informal and friendly during this thing. You can run as many times as you like, and your best time will be recorded for each class: Unlimited/Sidewinder/Open/Solo for a maximum of four entries. When the race period is over, I will post the collected times and a summary of the race, and pilots can share their screenshots, vidoes, routes and tactics with the world. \n \n So what's to keep me from faking my screenshots or lying about my ship's configuration? \n \nI can't stop you. Not at all. There are all kinds of ways you can cheat on this. The Wings update in particular makes cheating super easy. But in the real life, earth-bound Cannonball Run the competitors were doing it just for the hell of it, and  \" there was a gentlemen's agreement that the vehicle entered would be driven the entire distance, not having it transported on another vehicle, nor having an identical second vehicle hidden near the finish, etc. \"  That's the spirit of this little exercise. How fast can you make the run, using only your piloting skills the ship you've got? There's no need to cheat because what would that get you? There's no prize other than doing it. Besides, cheaters make Bucky sad. Do you want to make Bucky sad? Don't be that commander. Nobody likes that commander.   \n \n Thanks for the lecture. Anything else? \n \nNope, that about does it. \n \nLadies and gentlemen, start your engines. You may launch at any time. The  Shotgun Shine  is already docked at Cady and will be serving at both the start and finish. In light of the dangerous nature of the race, CMDR Ortilano is insisting that bar tabs are to be paid in full before you depart on your run. Good luck, Commanders! \n \nFAQ in a following post since this long-winded drawn out message always puts me close to the limit, and I can't post two messages in a row without getting concatenated.

Click here for the Buckyblog. \n \nBrought to you by... \n \n     ​ \n The  \" Buckyball \"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash,  widely known simply as  The Buckyball Run ,  was an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system,  intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n So what is it? \n \nThe Buckyball Run is the name of a series of point-to-point rally races through the space lanes of Elite Dangerous where pilots record their best time from start to finish. Commanders can make the run in whatever vessel they have provided it has the jump range. While the top slot usually belongs to the pilot with the deepest pockets, it might not be price, class, speed or range that ultimately determines the best time. (See Buckyball 5 for an example.) Besides, the Buckyball Run isn't just about coming in first, it's about taking the dare. Sidewinders and Haulers all the way up to fully tricked out Anacondas have all made the Run.  \n \n So... What's the deal this time? \n \n The Buckyball Run 6  is a checkpoint race, a grand tour of the great capital worlds of the inhabited galaxy; Alioth, Sol and Achenar. It's an event where anyone can come together and compete without animosity, regardless of where they're from. We're setting the example, providing a symbol of peace, unity and hope in these trying times when it seems like we're all just one jump away from war.  \n \nOr at least we were until those bureaucratic slagheads in Alioth, Sol and Achenar decided their systems were just tooooo fancy for the Buckyball. Really? Permits? There used to be a time when a Commander was free to set his or her own course in this universe, but now  THE MAN  says we need a piece of paper to even jump to those systems. Well I told them I'd get a whole roll for them the next time I went to the lavatory, but all that did was get me fined 630,000 credits and banned from all three systems. But what did they expect? I already had the bumper stickers printed up and everything.  \n \nPsh... Permits. So screw 'em. The Buckyball Run goes on. We'll just have to do a little swerving is all. And the Duvals? President Halsey? Whatever yahoo is in charge of the Alliance this week? If you're reading this, all of you just lost your after party privileges. You won't be allowed in, even if you bring a bottle. Cuz you need a PERMIT now, and none of you have one. How you like THEM apples, huh? \n \nFor everybody else, the  Shotgun Shine,  the Buckyball's official party barge, is in position at the finish line waiting to serve you a drink. As per tradition, the winner buys... \n \n Okay, so what are we doing, exactly? \n \nInstead of the capitals, we're hitting the FREEDOM LOVING independent systems right next door. Start from Froude Ring at STF 1774. But DON'T head to Alioth. Go to neighboring LP 131-66 and dock at Vasylev Vision for checkpoint one. Then launch and cruise on past Sol to Wolf 359 to dock at Powell High. Then, within jump range of the Imperial Capital of Achenar, finish out the race docked at Agartha in scenic Enoch Port. Hit them in order as fast as you can by a route of your choosing, taking screenshots of your dash clock when docked at each port as you go. (example below. No need to crop the picture, though) \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n What about classes? Do Sidewinders still compete with Sidewinders, and Vipers with Vipers, etc? \n \nShip modding has made classes irrelevant. We at the Buckyball Run tried to come up with a fair way to segregate racers by ship class, FSD type, cost, hair color, but there's really no way to do it without a whole lot of rules. Rules mean work and since Bucky does all the work around here I do my best to lighten the load for him. So we're gonna keep it as simple as possible. The race will be run in two classes: Unlimited, where you can race whatever you have, from a Sidewinder up to an Anaconda, configured however you like. Strip it down to the bare bones to increase your jump range. Load up with Rares to make a few creds along the way. You might not make first place, but who cares. It's the journey, not the destination. Unless you come in first in which case everybody else is a sucker for thinking they had the mad skillz required to take on the Champion. \n \nBut, to truly gauge the piloting skills of the Commanders you need a level playing field. I give you... \n \n The Sidewinder Challenge ​ To give pilots a chance to test their skills against other pilots instead of their bank accounts, we're bringing back the Sidewinder only class. With multiple ship ownership, this is a lot easier than back when you had to sell your baby to race a Sidey. It works like this: at Froude Ring, purchase a stock Sidewinder. (Talk to Sheila Swerski down at Swerski's Shipyard. She'll make you a good deal. Mention the Buckyball and get a free pair of fuzzy dice or pine tree air freshener, your choice.) Fit your stock Sidey with an A2 FSD. The whole package will run you less than 200K. Strip out the loaner pulse lasers to increase jump range. After that you can't change, remove, or add any other component. That means no fuel scoop, no thruster upgrades, no downgrades to remove mass, or anything else. You have to dock in order to refuel. Where and when is up to you. The purpose of this race is to put all your piloting skills to use: navigation, supercruise management, docking, the works. May the best pilot win. \n \nHere's what your Regulation Sidewinder should look like at launch: \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \nIf you've got a Sidewinder but don't want to follow these restrictions you can of course run it in the Unlimited class. It'd be cool to see exactly what a tricked out Sidey is capable of. \n \n How long does this take? \n \nWell the race is something like 250 light years total. Factor in refueling, you're looking at anything from 15-20 minutes in a long range ship up to an hour for a regulation Sidewinder. \n \n An HOUR? Ain't nobody got time for that! \n \nThat's why it's called the Sidewinder  Challenge.  You've read down this far. Don't wuss out now. \n \n Anything else? \n \nScreenshots will verify the racers' times. Take one before you launch and one each as you land at each of the three checkpoints. The difference between the time you launch at Froude and when you land at Enoch will be your time for the race. You will also need to provide a screenshot of your vessel in the Outfitting screen showing the internal configuration and performance stats. \n \nPilots recording video of the race do not need to take screenshots provided the recording shows the clock at takeoff and landing at each checkpoint as well as the Outfitting screen as outlined above. \n \nThe deadline to submit times is 23:59, Sunday, 25 January 3301 game time. You make as many attempts as you like. Open play and Solo times will be logged separately. Please note open or solo play when submitting your times. \n \nSo, to participate in the Buckyball Run 6: \n \n The Important Stuff (How to register and race) ​ \n Post your intent to race in this thread, or if you are not a forum member, email  (bucky at electricz dot net)  with your info. List the following: \n Your commander's name (if different than your user name) \n Ship Name  \n Ship Type \n Your answer for the Official Buckyball Question of the Race:  \" Who would you want if you could name anyone as your copilot? \" \n \n Make sure your ship is in tip-top shape at  Froude Ring in the STF 1774 system.  Make repairs, remove any excess mass, get it configured how you want it for the race. You should have at least 13 ly jump range to make the trip. \n Open the Outfitting screen and hit F10 for a screenshot of your ship. Be sure to capture Power Plant, Thruster, FSD and Distributor statistics. You will send this with your race time submission. \n Make sure you are on the surface and prepare for launch. If you start your clock in the hangar you'll be unhappy. \n Hit F10 to take a screenshot or start your video capture, showing your location and time. You need it in order to qualify your run. \n Launch and get going, champ! The clock is ticking! \n Navigate your way to these checkpoints in this order. How you get there is up to you: \n LP 131-66, Vasylev Vision  (near Alioth) \n Wolf 359, Powell High  (near Sol) \n Agartha, Enoch Port - FINISH  (near Achenar) \n \n Hit F10 to screenshot as soon as your dash clock comes up, showing your time and location. \n PM me links to your screenshots. There should be five total: your ship's configuration plus the four checkpoints. Don't post them in this thread. If you recorded video, send me the link. \n With your screenshots/video, include the following information: \n Your Ship Name \n Game Mode: Open or Solo/Private \n Your Race Time.  Time Duration Calculator  for easy calculation. \n \n Sit back, relax, have a drink or two (Bucky makes a mean martini!) and share tales of your race with your fellow Buckyballers for them to admire or ridicule as they see fit. Or, if you think you can do better, head on back to STF 1774 and do it again! You could even pick up some rares on the way to make it worth your while... \n \nSubmissions for race times will be accepted until 23:59, Sunday, 25 January, 3301 game time. If you are not a member of the forum and would like to participate anyway, email your links and route info to  (bucky at electricz dot net.) \n \n Sounds doable. Anything else? \n \nWe try to keep things informal and friendly during this thing. You can run as many times as you like, and your best time will be recorded for each class: Unlimited/Sidewinder/Open/Solo for a maximum of four entries. Make a note of your route list, but don't share it until the very end. When the race period is over, I will post the collected times and a summary of the race, and pilots can share their screenshots, vidoes, routes and tactics with the world. \n \n Important Rule Change for returning Buckyballers:  In previous races, if you destroyed your ship you had to start over. This was put in place way back in the day when respawning would always put you at Azeban and could be used to skip ahead depending on the position of the start and finish. Now, you restart at your last docking point which is its own penalty. So ship destruction is no longer grounds for a restart. \n \n So what's to keep me from faking my screenshots or lying about my ship's configuration? \n \nI can't stop you. Not at all. There are all kinds of ways you can cheat on this. But there's no prize for winning this race other than doing it. In the real life, earth-bound Cannonball Run the competitors were doing it just for the hell of it, and  \" there was a gentlemen's agreement that the vehicle entered would be driven the entire distance, not having it transported on another vehicle, nor having an identical second vehicle hidden near the finish, etc. \"  That's the spirit of this little exercise. How fast can you make the run, using only your piloting skills the ship you've got? There's no need to cheat because what would that get you? Besides, cheaters make Bucky sad. Don't be that commander. Nobody likes that commander.   \n \n Thanks for the lecture. Anything else? \n \nNope, that about does it. There's a FAQ in the next post.  \n \nLadies and gentlemen, start your engines. You may launch at any time. The  Shotgun Shine  has already departed for Agartha and the bar will be open by the time you dock. Good luck, Commander! \n \nEDIT: Well apparently the forums now merge two messages together after the same poster posts, so I'll have to wait until someone else comes along to post the FAQ... That's OK. I'm patient...

In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n So what is it? \n \nThe Buckyball Run is a series of point-to-point rally races within the navigable  \" capsule \"  of space in the Elite Dangerous beta, chosen so that anybody with a slightly modified ship* can measure their best time from start to finish. Commanders with more advanced vessels can make the runs as well, though to be fair times should only be compared with other ships of the same class. Even then, it might not be class, speed or range that ultimately determines the best time. \n \n So... What's the deal this time? \n \n The Buckyball Run 5  is a throwback to the original Buckyball Run, a straight-up race to the finish line.  Start at Daimler Settlement in Coelrind, dock at Skolem Settlement in Xi Wangkala as fast as you can, 143 light years away by a route of your choosing.  I suggest glancing the galactic map before takeoff. \n \nThe only other rule is that each use of the distress beacon for in flight refulling is a 10 minute penalty. Odds are you're going to screw up at least once and wind up in a system with no gas station. If you do, fess up and take the 10. Don't make Bucky do math and actually audit your bank account. Bucky  hates  doing math. \n \n So that's it? No cops? No smuggling? No checkpoints? \n \nThat's it. Just fly. Take a screenshot of the Station Services screen at launch to verify your starting time, ship, position and credit balnce, and take another at the end. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n Wait, these aren't the two most distant stars in the pill. What gives? \n \nYup, you are correct, but it's close enough. It was partially done to make sure low end ships could still make the trip, but also because the farthest points are dumps with no facilities or cheezball orbitals. I'm not gonna have everybody start and finish where they have to camp out, or when DaveB shows up in his party barge he can't dock because they only accept  \" medium \"  size ships. \n \nIt's also a good idea not to end in Federal space because the Federal Fun Police are looking to shut us down now. (It may have something to do with the roughly 50,000 Buckyball bumper stickers I paid to have stuck all over the outside of Daimler Settlement. They apparently didn't think it was funny, the crybabies. Which probably means you shouldn't loiter and whatever you do, don't say the word  \" Buckyball \"  while in dock... Being the Feds it's probably a capital offense.) \n \n What about classes? Do Sidewinders still compete with Sidewinders, and Vipers with Vipers, etc? \n \nThat's a good question. For this race, probably not. With ship modding, you can take a Sidewinder or Eagle and really give it legs. Of course the more money you have, the faster and farther your ship can go. Rather than doing it by ship type, it'd be cool to go by cost for determining factor racing class if I can figure out how. Regardless, there will probably be a special award for whoever makes it in the ship with the lowest jump distance rating. Really, though, just take whatever ship you have make the run just to see if you can do it. There's a whole lot of space out there to explore! \n \nOn that note: the base Sidey won't make it to the finish line this time around. You need a ship with at least 11 LY jump capability to reach the other end of the pill. There might be a route with less, but I haven't found it. \n \nAs usual, screenshots will verify the racers' times. Take a screenshot of the main Station Services screen before you launch, take one as you land. If you want to shave off a second or two, screenshot the clock immediately when you touch down, but be sure to capture the Station Services screen immediately afterwards. \n \nAlso as usual, people recording video of the race do not need to take screenshots but do need to open the Station Services screen for verification at the beginning and end. \n \nThe deadline to submit times is 23:59, 27 October, 3300 game time, prior to the launch of Beta 3. You make as many attempts as you like. \n \n The Important Stuff ​ \nPlan for 30-60 minutes to complete, less for larger ships, plus whatever time you need to plan your route. To break it down, follow this simple flight plan and checklist: \n \n \n Post your intent to race in this thread, or if you are not a forum member, email  (bucky at electricz dot net)  with your info. List the following: \n Your commander's name (if different than your user name) \n Ship Name \n Ship Type \n Specs for the ship: Power Plant, Thrusters, FSD and Power Distributor. \n(or the whole loadout if you want to brag. You can also take a screenshot of the outfitting screen showing the required stats.) \n Jump Range (unladen) \n Your answer for the Official Buckyball Question of the Race:  \" What's your favorite ship from any media? \" \n Note: Solo/multiplayer used to be here, but just include that with your individual time submissions in case you decide to try both. \n \n Make sure your ship is in tip-top shape at  Daimler Settlement in Coelrind.  Make repairs, remove any excess mass. You need at least 11 ly jump range to make the trip. \n Plan your route. Don't skip this step or you'll find out how much it sucks to have to backtrack or take penalties for emergency refuels. \n Make sure you are on the surface and prepare for launch. If you start your clock in the hangar you'll be unhappy. \n Open the Station Services screen and hit F10 to take a screenshot or start your video capture, showing your location and credit balance. You need it in order to qualify your run.  \n Launch and get going, champ! The clock is ticking! \n Navigate your way to  Skolem Settlement at Xi Wangkala  and dock. It's a bit of a hike, not gonna lie. \n Open the Station Services screen and hit F10 to screenshot. (You can save a second or two and screenshot the clock as soon as you touch down but you must follow it with the Station Services screenshot.) \n PM me links to your screenshots. (Do NOT post them.) Submissions for race times will be accepted until 23:59, 27 October, 3300 game time. OR if you are not a member of the forum and would like to participate anyway, email your links and route info to  (bucky at electricz dot net.) \n While awaiting the results, crack open a bottle and share tales of your exploits with your fellow Buckyballers to enjoy or ridicule as they see fit. \n \nAlso... \n \n Run the race using only one ship at a time. If you are destroyed or otherwise incapacitated, do not finish the race in a respawned Sidey or other replacement. Start over.  Exception: if your client hangs or crashes you may resume at your last save point, but unfortunately the clock does not stop since there's no way to verify how long you were out. \n Refuel only at stations. Emergency beacons are a no-no. If you push too far and have to call for a tanker, you will incur a ten-minute penalty. (Or restart to wipe the slate clean.) \n Make as many runs as you like. Your best time will be recorded at the end of the race. Racing multiple times in different ship types  is A-OK, and times for each will be recorded separately.  \n \nThe difference in times from the first screenshot at Daimler Settlement and your screenshot at Skolem Settlement the end will be the official time of your run. For video, it's the time you launch at Daimler until the time the clock appears upon touchdown when you return. The pilot with the shortest race time will be the winner. Again, we'll figure division/class winners as we go. Suggestions are welcome! \n \nBecause solo mode eliminates lag and congestion around star ports, solo pilots have a time advantage over people playing online. Please note if you are racing solo or multiplayer when submitting your times. \n \nThe credit balance will be to evaluate if the pilot utilized the emergency beacon for an in-flight refueling session. For each expenditure equaling the cost of an inflight refueling (class dependent) the pilot will incur a ten-minute penalty. This is to discourage the use of in-flight refueling using the distress beacon. So drive carefully, and don't run out of gas. Pilots of your caliber shouldn't have a problem.  (Well, the fuel thing may get you this time, but that's life in the big pill.) \n \nSend links to screenshots or video and route information to me via private message. Pilots need to provide screenshots of the start and finish. You will need to provide a route list, but don't provide it until the race is over. There's no way I can have it in my mailbox and not have it affect my planning. \n \nWhen the race period is over, I will post the collected times and a summary of the race. Then, sit back and enjoy the glory and admiration showered upon you by your fellow pilots. \n \n So what's to keep me from faking my screenshots or refuelling without admitting it or lying about my ship's stats? \n \nI can't stop you. There are all kinds of ways you can cheat. As in the real life, earth-bound Cannonball Run, there is no prize for winning other than doing it. In addition,  \" there was a gentlemen's agreement that the vehicle entered would be driven the entire distance, not having it transported on another vehicle, nor having an identical second vehicle hidden near the finish, etc. \"  That's the spirit of this little exercise. How fast can you make the run, using only your piloting skills the ship you've got? There's no need to cheat because what would that get you? Don't be that commander. Nobody likes that commander.   \n \n Thanks for the lecture. Anything else? \n \nNope, that about does it. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. You may launch at any time. The  Shotgun Shine  has already departed for Skolem Settlement and the bar will be open by the time you dock. Good luck, Commander! \n \nFAQ in the next post.

Does anyone actually read the fine print? \nTimes updated daily, or when I feel like it. ​ \n The  \" Buckyball \"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash,  widely known simply as  The Buckyball Run,  was an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system,  intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n So what is it? \n \nThe Buckyball Run is a series of point-to-point rally races within the navigable  \" bubble \"  of space in the Elite Dangerous beta, chosen so that anybody with a base Sidewinder can measure their best time from start to finish. Commanders with more advanced vessels can make the runs as well, though to be fair times should only be compared with other ships of the same class. Even then, it might not be class, speed or range that ultimately determines the best time. \n \n So... What's with the cops this time? \n \n The Buckyball Run 4  is a little bit different than previous Buckyball Runs which were straight up races to the finish. You see, this time when Bucky pulled the name out of the hat to determine the finish line, it came up Chango Dock. Now there's always an after party after a Buckyball Run, and as it turns out, alcohol is illegal there. Who knew? Well, we already paid the non-refundable deposit for the landing pads, and hell if we're going to eat almost ninety credits by cancelling, so this time we're asking each racers to bring some booze to help cover the inevitable fines. Beer, wine, liquor. Whatever you can get your hands on. Just three or four tons per pilot. Should be plenty. \n \n So wait, we have to pay for the cargo to be in this race? And it's illegal where we're taking it? \n \nWell yeah, but only if you get caught. If you don't get caught, you can sell what we don't drink for a nice profit. Relax, I know guy who will take it off your hands. So just don't get caught. With all the trouble over at Eranin, they're just scanning people for weapons anyway. Oh, and by the way... The fans have been clamoring for something a little more exotic than what you can pick up at Eranin and Freeport. Might need to go a bit further out, pick up some imports... \n \nSo really this is a race just like before, but you just have to pick up some illegal cargo and sneak it back to the finish line. No sweat.  Oh yeah, and I don't know where else to get the goods, so you might have to do some research. \n \nAs usual, the Sidewinders and Vipers are each in their own class. Everybody else races together. Sidewinders need to bring back at least three tons of booze of any kind; beer, wine or liquor. All other classes need to bring back four. We're not looking for hard core drugs, smokes or narcotics. Just a little liquid refreshment. And each ton of booze needs to come from a different port. You know, for variety's sake.  \n \nTwo easy stops are Eranin and Freeport. They're close by and always well stocked. As for the additional ton for the Sidey and the additional TWO tons for everyone else, you guys are smart. I'm sure you'll figure out something.  Note that Freeport may be out of booze when you get there. If it is, it still counts as a completed checkpoint. Take a screenshot of the empty market to prove you tried. That's good enough for Bucky. \n \nAs usual, screenshots will verify the racers reach each checkpoint. Take a screenshot after you touch down at any port to show the station time. To make sure that each ton of cargo comes from a different port, take a screenshot of the transaction page showing your location and purchase. As usual, people recording video of the race do not need to take screenshots. \n \nTo summarize there are three or four checkpoints depending on the class: \n \nSTART: Chango Dock (I Bootis) \n \nCHECKPOINTS: (In any order) \n Azeban City (Eranin) \n Freeport (LP 98-132)  If Freeport is out of alcohol, take a picture of the market as evidence and move on. It will count as complete. You do not need to go elsewhere for more cargo. \n Additional Stop #1 \n Additional Stop #2 (unlimited class only) \n \nFINISH: Chango Dock (I Bootis) \n \nThe deadline to submit times is 23:59, September 28, 3300 game time. You make as many attempts as you like. \n \nPlan for 30-45 minutes to complete, less for larger ships, plus whatever time you need to locate the additional liquor stores. To break it down, follow this simple flight plan and checklist: \n \n \n Post your intent to race in this thread. List the following: \n Your commander's name (if different than your user name) \n Ship Name \n Ship Class \n Solo or multiplayer. \n Your answer for the Official Buckyball Question of the Race:  \" What's your favorite drink? \" \n \n Do some research and find out who's got the best booze on sale. Don't just go for the cheap stuff at Azeban and Freeport. This is a classy operation here. (By the way we need someone to bring the red plastic party cups, too.) \n Make sure your ship is in tip-top shape at Chango Dock and repair any hull damage. Remove any excess mass. (Especially important for Sidewinders to complete the race.) \n Plan your route. Open the galactic map, lay out a step-by-step path, make sure you know where you're going. \n Open the commodities market and hit F10 to take a screenshot or start your video capture, showing your location and credit balance. (This is a good spot to alt-tab to desktop, check your folder, and make sure screenshots are saving. Plus you need it in order to qualify your run. Opening the market verifies your location, your credit balance, and cargo status in one handy screen.) \n Make sure you are on the surface and prepeare for launch. Hit F10 to take screenshot of your cockpit view, showing your location and time.  \n Launch and get going, champ! The clock is ticking! \n Jump to each checkpoint and dock. Hit F10 to take a screenshot of the station time, then open the commodities screen to make your transaction complete with a screenshot. (It's always a good idea to keep your receipts.)  \n After all checkpoints are cleared (and screenshotted) navigate to and dock back at Chango. Screenshot immediately upon touchdown as per step 5. \n Open the ship's status screen to the cargo manifest and hit F10 to screenshot. \n PM me links to your screenshots. (Do NOT post them.) Submissions for race times will be accepted until 23:59, September 28, 3300 game time. \n While awaiting the results, crack open some of those bottles you brought and share tales of your exploits with your fellow Buckyballers to enjoy or ridicule as they see fit. \n \n Sounds do-able. What are the rules?  \n \nScreenshots (or video) of the station clock will verify the pilot's course and time. The cargo transactions will show the checkpoints were reached.  \n \nThe difference in times from the first screenshot at Chango and your cockpit screenshot at the end will be the official time of your run. For video, it's the time you launch at Chango until the time the clock appears upon touchdown when you return. The pilot with the shortest race time and complete cargo manifest  will be declared the winner of the particular race class: \n \n \n Sidewinder Class (Sidewinders only) - 3 tons of alcohol from different locations. \n Viper Class (Vipers Only) - 4 tons of alcohol from different locations. \n Open Class (Any other ship class) - 4 tons of alcohol from different locations. \n Solo Class - same as above, but for solo players \n \nBecause solo mode eliminates lag and congestion around star ports, solo pilots have a time advantage over people playing online. You can race solo if you like but your time will be compared only with other solo racers. Please note if you are racing solo or multiplayer when posting your times. \n \nThe credit balance will be to evaluate if the pilot utilized the emergency beacon for an in-flight refueling session. For each expenditure equaling the cost of an inflight refueling (class dependent) or costs to repair the hull, the pilot will incur a ten-minute penalty. This is to discourage the use of in-flight refueling using the distress beacon or hazardous flying resulting in major hull repairs. So drive carefully, and don't run out of gas. Pilots of your caliber shouldn't have a problem with either. \n \nSend links to screenshots or video and route information to me via private message. Pilots need to provide all screenshots of the start and finish as well as each checkpoint for verification. Because of the scattered nature of this race, a route list is not necessary but you might want to provide one anyway at the end to compare with other racers. I know it's a pain in the  to upload the screenies but my lawyers say it has to be done. As usual, video submissions do not require screenshots. \n \nWhen the race period is over, I will post the collected times and a summary of the race. Then, sit back and enjoy the glory and admiration showered upon you by your fellow pilots. \n \n Gracious! Is that everything? \n \nNo, there's more. (sorry.) \n \n \n Run the race using only one ship at a time. If you are destroyed or otherwise incapacitated, do not finish the race in a respawned Sidey or other replacement. Start over. \n Refuel only at stations. Emergency beacons are a no-no. If you push too far and have to call for a tanker, re-start your run, or incur a ten-minute penalty. \n Make as many runs as you like. Your best time will be recorded at the end of the race. Racing multiple times in different classes is A-OK, and times for each will be recorded separately. You may register only one ship in each class, Sidewinder or Unlimited. \n \n These are the important rules. More FAQ-like stuff in next post... \n \nCorrection.

In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n So what is it? \n \nThe Buckyball Run is a series of point-to-point rally races within the navigable  \" bubble \"  of space in the Elite Dangerous beta, chosen so that anybody with a base Sidewinder can measure their best time from start to finish. Commanders with more advanced vessels can make the runs as well, though to be fair times should only be compared with other ships of the same class. Even then, it might not be class, speed or range that ultimately determines the best time. \n \n Sounds interesting. What do I have to do? \n \n The Buckyball Run 3  is a checkpoint race where pilots start docked at WCM Transfer Orbital at LHS-3006, then race to seven designated checkpoints and finish docked at Romanek's Folly at Morgor, as quickly as possible. The pilot is free to choose whichever route seems fastest, as long as the ship starts at LHS-3006, hits all of the checkpoints, and finishes docked at Romanek's Folly. Screenshots or video will corroborate times. Pilots providing links to a recording of their runs are not required to provide screenshots, though there is one additional verification requirement. (See below.) \n \n Unlike the previous race, checkpoints in Buckyball Run 3 do not require docking. Pilots only have to jump to the system to count. The only time docking is required is at the start, the finish, and for refueling. \n \nIn order to verify checkpoints are hit, pilots will open the galactic map showing the clock and their location and take a screenshot, To maintain time equity, all pilots must open the GalMap at each checkpoint, even if they are recording the race, though recorded runs still do not have to provide separate screenshots. Each checkpoint reached without opening the map will incur a 5-second penalty for recorded runs, and disqualify the pilot if using screenshots. \n \nIf you are refueling at a station in a checkpoint system, a screenshot or video recording of the docking counts as checkpoint verification. You were obviously in the checkpoint system. \n \nBasically, you have to pop open the map every time you jump, and screenshot it if you are not recording video. C'mon, don't look at me like that. It's better than docking, isn't it? \n \nTo summarize: \n \nSTART: WCF Transfer Orbital (LHS-3006) \n \nCHECKPOINTS: (In any order) \n Asellus Primus \n Aulin \n BD+47 2112 \n Dahan \n Eranin \n  I Bootis \n Styx \n FINISH: Morgor, docked at Romanek's Folly. \n \nThe deadline to submit times is 23:59, September 7, 3300 game time. You make as many attempts as you like. \n \nPlan for 20-30 minutes to complete. To break it down, follow this simple flight plan and checklist: \n \n \n Post your intent to race in this thread. List the following: \n Your commander's name (if different than your user name) \n Ship Name \n Ship Class \n Solo or multiplayer. \n Your answer for the Official Buckyball Question of the Race:  \" What is your theme song? \" \n \n Make sure your ship is in tip-top shape at WCF Transfer Orbital and repair any hull damage. Remove any excess mass. (Especially important for Sidewinders to complete the race.) \n Plan your route. Open the galactic map, lay out a step-by-step path, make sure you know where you're going.  \n Open the commodities market and hit F10 to take a screenshot or start your video capture, showing your location and credit balance. (This is a good spot to alt-tab to desktop, check your folder, and make sure screenshots are saving. Plus you need it in order to qualify your run. Opening the market verifies your location, your credit balance, and cargo status in one handy screen.) \n Make sure you are on the surface and prepeare for launch. Hit F10 to take screenshot of your cockpit view, showing your location and time. If you plan to crop your screenshots, include the center panel showing location and time, and the right center panel showing your ship. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n Launch and get going, champ! The clock is ticking! \n Jump to each checkpoint and open the Galactic Map. If you are not recording, take a screenshot each time you emerge from hyperspace. If you are recording, you still have to open the map to maintain parity. \n After all checkpoints are cleared (and screenshotted) navigate to and dock at Romanek's Folly at Morgor. Screenshot immediately upon touchdown as per step 5. \n Open the commodities market and hit F10 to screenshot, showing your location, credit balance and cargo status. \n PM me your route as well as links to your screenshots. (Do NOT post them.) Submissions for race times will be accepted until 23:59, September 7, 3300 game time. \n While awaiting the results, enjoy a cold one, and share tales of your exploits for your fellow Buckyballers to enjoy or ridicule as they see fit. \n \n Sounds do-able. What are the rules? What's with the Galactic Map this time? \n \nScreenshots (or video) of the Galactic Map will verify the pilot's course and time. Even though video recordings are solid proof a pilot reached each checkpoint, they still have to open up the map. Unfortunately opening the map takes 3-4 seconds and slows a ship to a halt, and this time difference has to be factored in by pilots recording their run out of fairness to people without recording capability. I know it's lame, but until they build a clock into the dash, recording into the game, or enable the Pilot's Log, we gotta do it. \n \nThe difference in times from the first screenshot at WCF Transfer Orbital and your cockpit screenshot at Romanek's Folly will be the official time of your run. For video, it's the time you launch at WCF until the time the clock appears upon touchdown at Romanek. The pilot with the shortest race time will be declared the winner of the particular race class: \n \n \n Sidewinder Class (Sidewinders only) \n Unlimited Class (Any ship class) \n Solo Class \n \nBecause solo mode eliminates lag and congestion around star ports, solo pilots have a time advantage over people playing online. You can race solo if you like but your time will be compared only with other solo racers. Please note if you are racing solo or multiplayer when posting your times. \n \nThe credit balance will be to evaluate if the pilot utilized the emergency beacon for an in-flight refueling session. For each expenditure equaling the cost of an inflight refueling (class dependent) or costs to repair the hull, the pilot will incur a ten-minute penalty. This is to discourage the use of in-flight refueling using the distress beacon or hazardous flying resulting in major hull repairs. So drive carefully, and don't run out of gas. Pilots of your caliber shouldn't have a problem with either. \n \nSend links to screenshots or video and route information to me via private message. Pilots need to provide all screenshots of the start and finish as well as each checkpoint for verification, and provide a route list including refueling stops and anything interesting that happened on the way. I know it's a pain in the  to upload all of them, but my lawyers say it has to be done. As usual, video submissions do not require screenshots.  \n \nWhen the race period is over, I will post the collected times and a summary of the race. Then, sit back and enjoy the glory and admiration showered upon you by your fellow pilots. \n \n Gracious! Is that everything? \n \nNo, there's more. (sorry.) \n \n \n Run the race using only one ship. If you are destroyed or otherwise incapacitated, do not finish the race in a respawned Sidey or other replacement. Start over. \n Refuel only at stations. Emergency beacons are a no-no. If you push too far and have to call for a tanker, re-start your run, or incur a ten-minute penalty. \n Make as many runs as you like. Your best time will be recorded at the end of the race. Racing multiple times in different classes is A-OK, and times for each will be recorded separately. \n \n All that and you want a race summary too? What's that look like? \n \nSomething like this: \n \nSubject: Buckyball Run 3 result \nCommander Name: ElectricZ \nShip's Name: Miss Adventure IV \nShip Class: Sidewinder \nArmaments/Loadout: Stripped \nRoute: LHS-3006 (Start), Checkpoint 1, Checkpoint 2, Checkpoint 3 (Docked at XYZ  for refuel), Checkpoint 4, Checkpoint 5, Checkpoint 6 (Docked at ABC for refuel), Checkpoint 7, Checkpoint 8, Morgor (Docked at Romanek's Folly for finish) \n \n These are the important rules.

Try the Buckyball Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash \n \n The race may be over but anyone can still make the run!  \nPost your screenshotted times and they will be recorded.  \nThe record stands at 6 minutes, 34 seconds.

Three Buckyballers have made their runs available for streaming: \nFoxTwo:  http://youtu.be/WgpeKD6dqHI \nSpacePirateCaine:  http://www.twitch.tv/spacepiratecaine/c/4875729 \nVargur:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9pBc3npSvA \n \n \nStay tuned for details for the second Buckyball Run, coming to a spaceport near YOU! ​ \n \n \n The  \" Buckyball \"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash , widely known simply as  The Buckyball Run,  is an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system. The first run was not a real competitive race, as there was only one team running, but was intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n So what is it? \n \n The Buckyball Run  is a point-to-point rally race from the system of Magec to Wyrd within the navigable  \" bubble \"  of space in the Elite Dangerous beta, chosen so that anybody with a base Sidewinder can measure their best time from start to finish. Commanders with more advanced vessels can make the run as well, though to be fair times should only be compared with other ships of the same class. Even then, it might not be speed or range that ultimately determines the best time. \n \n Sounds interesting. What do I have to do? \n \nNavigate and dock at Xiaoguan Hub in Magec, then get to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system as fast as you can. \n \n That's all? What are the rules? \n \nTo quote Dr. Dealgood,  \" I know you won't break the rules... There aren't any. \"  Actually there's one teeny-weeny little rule, but it's a simple one. Take a screenshot as you sit on the launch pad at Xiaoguan and another upon landing at Vonarburg at the finish that show the time and location of your docked space ship. The difference in times will be the official time of your run. Post them here, along with the specs of your ship. Then sit back and enjoy the glory and admiration showered upon you by your fellow pilots. For added flavor, post your route, your control rig, and tell us a little about what happened on the way.  \n \nHere's a simple format to follow, showing the route of the intrepid Commander Braben in 3102. \n \nCommander Name: Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben \nShip's Name: Shotgun Shine \nShip Class: Stock Sidewinder \nArmaments/Loadout: 2 pulse lasers \nRoute taken: Magec, Ovid, Opala, I Bootis (Refueled at Chango, interdicted) Eranin, Asellus Primus, Dahan, Morgor (Docked at Romanek's Folly for fuel, interdicted on the way), BD 47+2112, Wyrd (Docked Vonaburg Co-Operative to finish)  \nSolo/MP: Solo \nTime: 00:32:15 \n \n Do I have to use a Sidewinder? \n Only if you want to run a  \" pure \"  Buckyball Run. Any class can be used, though you should only compare your times with the same class. Obviously long range ships will have an easier time of it, and it will become a contest of who can launch and dock the fastest. \n \n I fly an Eagle. I can't reach those systems. \nBWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Sorry. Wait for the next upgrade. \n UPDATE - BREAKING NEWS - WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG! \nBuckyballer Extraordinaire Jackie Silver proved that if you strip an Eagle of its weapons, thermal insulation, life support and fuzzy dice, the Eagle can make the run in fine style! The Buckyball Run tips it's hat to Commander Silver and his British Racing Green Eagle,  Goodbye Princeton! \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n Do I have to race against other people? \nThis is a rally race, so you're racing the clock and comparing your time to others. Actual live racing would be difficult at this stage of the beta. \n \n Do I have to play online then? \nNo, but you should just for the heck of it, and you should definitely note if your time is in solo mode because it does make a difference. Sure, multiplayer adds lag and a bunch of traffic but that's part of the unpredictability life brings. The added complexity of getting in and out of a crowded station also makes it much more challenging, and separates the separates the rocket aces from the future smoking craters. So let's see how fast you can get that big fat Nine of yours into the slot, chum, between the Anaconda loitering in the middle and that Sidewinder squeezing out the opposite side! \n \n How do I take screenshots? \nTo take a screenshot press 'F10' to put a screenshot into The Frontier Developments\\Elite Dangerous folder in your 'My Pictures' folder.  \n \n How do I post a screenshot? \nFirst you have to have a place to store it online. I recommend  imgur , a free picture storage site. Registration is free. All you have to do do is upload it to imgur. \n \nOnce uploaded, look for a link to copy into your message here on the ED forum using BBCODE. It will look something like IMG  http://i.imgur.com/26GLlho.jpg?1  IMG. When you post that in your message, it will show your screenshot. Or, alternately, click the little postcard-looking icon on the message editor menu and paste in your URL. \n \n I forgot to take a screenshot when I launched/landed. \nBummer. We'll name the next run  \" There and back again \"  in your honor. \n \n What do I win? \nAll the virtual groupies and fans you can imagine and the accolades of your fellow commanders on this board. \n \n No, I mean, what do I win that's TANGIBLE? \nWhat, like prize money? A trophy? This is an unsanctioned event run off of a message board, so I got nothing. Not only that, but people will may be posting new times for as long as this remains interesting, so odds are a winning time won't stand forever. Plus the different classes of ships make direct competition more difficult. We'd have to start sorting winners by class, cost, skill level... That's too much work. This is supposed to be fun, remember? I might put up a leaderboard somewhere, if there's enough interest. \n \nWhat you  can  get out of this is better skills at navigation, docking, collision avoidance, and interdiction avoidance. Under the gun to make a good time while trying this out, my docking went from  \" easy, easy, OH GOD STOP \"  to being able to do an uninterrupted velocity landing through the slot down to the pad. Not only does it make you feel like a stud, it's a skill that will stick with you. \n \nYour stories will also help other commanders learn from your experience. And, you get to do something that makes the ED universe a litte more alive. Plus, it's fun. You like fun, don't you? \n \n I don't like fun. \n Give this this game a shot then. \n \n I didn't get anywhere close to a winning time. \nPost it anyway, and try again. This is for fun, remember? \n \n I had to stop and get fuel. Does that count against my time? \nTime waits for no one, and neither does the Run. \n \n I had to pay for it, too. This is costing me money! \nYou'll definitely want a few hundred creds in the bank for fuel. You can always trade along the way, but that clock is ticking... \n \n I got interdicted. Waaaaaah! \nSee  \" I had to stop and get fuel \"  above. Hope you got away! \n \n I lost my ship. Waaaaaah! \nThree words: In. Sure. Ants. By simply reading this post you agree to hold me blameless for any losses incurred during the race. P.S. Don't risk what you can't afford to lose.  \n \n I've got fines/have a bounty on my head now, thanks to this stupid race. Waaaaaah! \nShame on you. You should feel bad for whatever you did. But that's the game, isn't it? That poor sucker in a hauler with a full load you rammed going through the slot has every right to put a bounty on you for wrecking his livelihood. Don't be a jerk and remember to ask for clearance and you should be okay in the future. \n \n Anything else I should know? \nYeah. Have fun and don't cheat. There's no need to cheat because what would that prove? If you have a bottomless bank account, you can snapshot yourself in a Sidewinder, switch over a bigger ship, jump to the end and switch back to a Sidewinder and grab a snap in the end. What a stud. Or, you could play in Solo mode for loading speed decrease and say you were playing live to shave off a minute or two. Again, for what? Don't be that commander. Nobody likes that commander.  In the real life, earth-bound Cannonball Run,  \" there was a gentlemen's agreement that the vehicle entered would be driven the entire distance, not having it transported on another vehicle, nor having an identical second vehicle hidden near the finish, etc. \"  That's the spirit of this little exercise. How fast can you go, using the ship you've got. Beyond that, if it's in the game, it's legal. I think it's incumbent of anyone who posts a  \" holy cow! \"  run time to explain how they did it, or run the risk of being labeled  \" That commander... \" \n \nSo... Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. You may launch at any time. I'll be waiting right here to gather your times. Good luck!

And the best thing is, there's no need to struggle with unfamiliar HOTAS bindings this year - you can all use your own control setups - so there's no excuse for not bringing your absolute A game to this one! \n \nThe race is a classic Buckyball time trial and will run from 00:00 on Friday morning until 23:59 on Sunday. During that time you can run the race at any time, on any platform, and as many times as you like, submitting a series of screenshots to certify the time for each run. I'll be checking these and maintaining a scoreboard over the course of the weekend so you'll be able to see how your runs compare with everyone elses. \n \nThere will be prizes for the top 3 times (kindly donated by Frontier) of a Frontier Mamba paint job, an Expedition prize pack and a Gravity prize pack. You can view these over here:  giveaway-community-prize-packs-and-paint-jobs . First choice goes to the winner, second place picks next and third place takes whatever is left. \n \nThe race starts and finishes at Lave Station and can be performed in any small or medium sized ship. You should be docked at a landing pad, up on the surface and facing the mailslot. When you're ready to go take a screenshot which shows the clock in the top-right hand corner of the HUD and then hit launch. Fly to each of the following outposts in the order given and land, taking another screenshot once you're safely down (each shot should clearly show the station services menu and HUD clock): \n1) Almagro Port, Reorte \n2) Diamond Landing, Gurney Slade \n3) Patsayev Base, Hajanheimr \n4) Clark Enterprise, Heheng \nLastly fly back to Lave Station, land, and take a final screenshot (again, with the HUD clock and station serices menu visible). \n \nI recommend using a set of numbered bookmarks for these stations to make route plotting far easier. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nIn total at the end of your run you should have 6 screenshots. You now need to upload these to an image sharing website such as IMGUR. \nNext start a new forum conversation with me using a subject line of  \" Lavecon 2020 Buckyball \"  and include the following details in the message: \n1) Your commander name. \n2) Which platform you're using (PC, XBOX or PS4). \n3) The type of ship you're flying (if you're flying  Ozric's regulation Eagle build  as mentioned in the FAQ then please say so) \n4) The name of your ship. \n5) The time you're claiming for your run (this is the difference in time between the first and last screenshot). \n6) A link to where I can find your screenshots. \n \nNOTE: since the fleet carrier update the date and time have been removed from the station services menu which means we're now totally reliant on being able to see the HUD clock. Under certain circumstances this might be hard (if not impossible) to read. For example, when using a Cobra MkIII, the final landing time is often completely obscured by a bright light on the landing pad. If this happens then immediately hit the button to enter the station and take another screenshot as soon as the clock becomes visible. I'll do my best to try and estimate your actual landing time based on this. \n \nIf you wish to video your run then that's fine (and is actually better for you since you don't have to worry about hitting the screenshot button at key moments) but I would ask that you then review your video and take screenshots of the key moments to be submitted as described. \n \nHere's a short video demonstrating the circuit with some tips about how to go about improving your time. \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \nFeel free to post your intent to take part in the race in this forum thread along with any further questions you may have. If they're good then I'll add an FAQ to this post. \n \nLastly, if you want to chat about the race (either beforehand or over the weekend), or if you're just interested in the Buckyball Racing Club then feel free to drop into our Discord server. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n FAQ \n \nQ) Are there any limitations or classes for this race? \nA)  No, not really. I wanted to keep this nice and simple (it's a  \" rush job \"  after all) so run whatever damn ship you fancy. The only obvious loophole I'll close right now tho' is - you're not allowed to die during the run (e.g. to get yourself transported back to the start line). If you have an idea which feels like it  \" might \"  be cheating then please check it with me first. \n \n Q) Really? No regulation ship? \nA)   sigh  - oh OK then, if people want to fly a regulation ship that puts them on an even footing with others doing the same then they can use  Ozric's Eagle build  over here. I'm only going to maintain a single scoreboard (with one set of prizes) but I'll ask that anyone flying this Eagle build please let me know in their submission and I'll add a mark of honour next to their entry. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t

\"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash , widely known simply as The Buckyball Run, was an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system, intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n \n Did you steal that from one of ElectricZ's old event posts? \n \nDon't think of it as plagurism, but more like completing your assignment the night before its due while copying large swathes of text from wikipedia with what you hope is good enough content for a 'passing grade'.  It's not like I had the event planned differently before the Fleet Carrier update came out and I've had to suddenly change things! \n \n So... What's the deal this time? \n \nThe Engineer's Canyon Mayhem is a checkpoint race with a grand tour of the more 'easily' accessable Engineer canyon bases; Farseer Inc, Demolition Unlimited, Trophy Camp, Long Sight Base and Black Hide. \n \n What about classes? \n \nThere's really no way to do it without a whole lot of rules. Rules mean work. \nSo we're gonna keep it as simple as possible. \nThe race will be run in four classes: \n \n Class 1 - Mothership with SLF^ class,  \n Where you can race one of the 10 fighter hanger compatible ships   (^ if you're rich enough why not fit an SRV bay, then you can choose between SLF and SRV at each location) . \n Class 2 - Ship with SRV Challenge, \nI doubt any one  sane person will do this. Maybe it'll be 60 mintues, maybe it'll be 120 minutes, its here if you're crazy enough to find out! \n Class 3 - Elite Racer Unlimited, \nWhere you can race whatever you have, so long as it'll fit through the tight obstacle course at each engineer base. You just need to fit space for 5 passengers. \n \nBut, to truly gauge the piloting skills of the Commanders you need a level playing field. I give you... \n \n Class 4 - The Regulation Budget Eagle, \n Regulation Budget Eagle build link \nTo give pilots a chance to test their skills against other pilots instead of their bank accounts! \nIt works like this: at Xiaoguan Station in the Krinda system, you can purchase a stock Eagle with all the outfitting required at the same station. (Talk to Tara Stafford down at the Less for More Shipyard. She'll make you a good deal. Mention the Buckyball and get a free pair of fuzzy dice or pine tree air freshener, your choice.) \nFit your stock Eagle with a 3A FSD, 3E Economy Passenger Cabin, 2E Economy Passenger Cabin  &  1A Fuel Scoop. The whole package will run you less than 700K. \nStrip out the loaner pulse lasers, cargo rack, shields and assist supercruise and docking to increase jump range. After that you can't change, remove, or add any other component. That means, no enhanced thrusters upgrade, no downgrades to remove mass, or anything else. The purpose of this race is to put all your piloting skills to use: navigation, supercruise management, docking, the works. May the best pilot win. \n \nIf you've got an Eagle but don't want to follow these restrictions you can of course run it in the Unlimited class. It'd be cool to see exactly what a tricked out Eagle is capable of. \n \n \nRace whatever you have from a Sidewinder up to an Anaconda, configured however you like. Strip it down to the bare bones to increase your jump range. Load up with Rares to make a few creds along the way. You might not make first place, but who cares. It's the journey, not the destination. Unless you come in first in which case everybody else is a sucker for thinking they had the mad skillz required to take on the Champion. \n \n Why am I taking passengers? \n \nYou don't actually have to take passengers, just have the space to imagine you are. \nReal passengers can be so needy. \n \n How long does this take? \n \nWell the race is something like 465-490 light years total. Factor in racing about each engineer base, you're looking at anything from 40-60 minutes in the 3 'main' classes, up to 90 minutes in the Regulation Budget Eagle Challenge. \n \n One HOUR? Ain't nobody got time for that! \n \nThat's why it's called the SRV Challenge. You've read down this far. Don't wuss out now. \n \n Anything else? \n\t\t \n\t \n \n THE TL-DR VERSION \nEngineer sightseeing tour for race enthusiasts, \nTake a ship that can take at least 5 passengers, to the 5 beginner engineers bases, in any order. \n \n CLASSES \nClass 1 - Mothership with SLF class,  \n Compatible ships \nYou can fit an SRV bay as well, allowing the option to choose which to use at each base. \nOnce at each base, park your ship at a location for your passengers to watch you either, \n_ Use the SLF to complete 3 laps around the provided circuit, OR \n_ Use the SRV to complete 1 lap around the provided circuit ( Special rules for SRV below ). \n \n Class 2 - Ship with SRV Challenge, \nI doubt any one  sane person will do this. \nMaybe it'll take 30 mintues, maybe it'll be 120 minutes, its here if you're crazy enough to find out! \nOnce at each base, park your ship at a location for your passengers to watch you \n_ Use the SRV to complete 1 lap around the provided circuit ( Special rules for SRV below ). \n \n NOTE \nShips and SLF must start the engineer base circuits from the  start line . \nSRV's can start at any point, once a full lap is complete can 'return' to ship. \n \n Class 3 - Elite Racer Unlimited, \nRace anything between the engineer bases, but also use it to race the circuit at each engineer base.Just make sure it'll fit through the tight obstacle course at each engineer base. You'll still need to fit space for 5 passengers. \n \n Class 4 - The Regulation Budget Eagle, \n Regulation Budget Eagle build link \n \nIt can get a little toasty trying to scoop fuel for the next jump. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n TRACK \n \n START (docked at any engineer base) \n Visit each of the other engineer bases, remember to have completed the circuit before visiting the next \n FINISH (after doing the circuit, be back in your mothership docked at the final engineer base) \n > > > > > > > > > >  ENGINEERS CIRCUITS  < < < < < < < < < < \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Trophy Camp - Tod 'The Blaster' McQuinn\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Black Hide - The Dweller\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Farseer Inc - Felicity Farseer\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Long Sight Base - Elvire Martuuk\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Demolition Unlimited - Liz Ryder\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n SUBMISSIONS \n \nEVENT STARTS 20-06-2020 and ENDs 28-06-2020 (at 23:59:59 game time)   < ============================================ \nentries where the timer starts before 23:59:59 will be accepted. \n \nScreenshots (or video) will verify the racers' times. \n \nStart, Finish and showing Passenger modules^. \n- For each engineer base I need to see, \n-- Docked at the engineer base \n-- When you start your lap in ship/SLF/SRV. \n-- When you finish your lap in ship/SLF/SRV. \n \n^ can be done from outfitting or systems panel. \n+ modules screenshot - if you're in the Regulation Budget Eagle. \n \nSo you should end up with around 16 screenshots.

Buckyball Racing Club Presents: Signs Of Life ​ \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t The Buckyball Racing Club website:  http://www.buckyballracing.org.uk \nThe Buckyball Racing Club Discord server:  https://discord.gg/YwxcsCf \n \nThe Signs Of Life race involves visiting as many different locations where life of one sort or another can be found, scanning the different types of life form present and returning to the starting system within a fixed time limit. The time limit is 30 minutes for Regulation DBX and 1 hour for Unlimited. At each life-bearing location, it is required to scan a life form with the Composition Scanner, which grants the CMDR a Codex voucher upon completion, if it is the first time that type of life form has been scanned in that particular visit to that star system (i.e. if you scan two types of brain trees in one system, only the first will give you the voucher). The winner will be the CMDR who has scanned the most in the time available and returned to the start point intact. Scans after the time limit will not count. Excess time will be used to determine placings in the event of a tie.  \nYou can run the race as many times as you like and try to improve over the duration of the event. If you choose to submit a run for consideration, please do so with 48 hours of that attempt, if possible (see  Submitting a Race Entry ). \n \nThere are two separate race classes:  Regulation DBX  and  Unlimited . The Regulation DBX has a fixed loadout and may not be engineered but the build has a jump range of over 37 LY and costs about 7.7 MCr: it is intended to both allow a level playing field and to encourage relatively new players to race. In Unlimited, any ship with any fittings and engineering can take part, including the use of Guardian FSD boosters, except for Supercruise Assist and Docking Computer systems. The use of Synthesis for FSD boosting is not allowed in either category but getting a boost from the jet cones of white dwarfs and neutron stars is permissible in both. \n Note that it is necessary to have Elite: Dangerous: Horizons to participate . The race requires visiting locations on planetary surfaces. The race has a fixed time limit of 30 minutes for Regulation DBX and 1 hour for Unlimited. Participants may take part in any play mode they wish but Open play is encouraged in order to meet other racers on the course. \n \n Regulation Diamondback Explorer build : \n https://coriolis.io/outfit/diamondback_explorer?code=A0p0tdFfldddsdf5---03---33-43--v6-2i.Iw18SQ==.Aw18SQ==..EweloBhBmSQUwIYHMA28QgIwVyKBQA== \nThe DBX and its components should all be available at Scully-Power Station in Ix. This also benefits from the 15% discount due to being in Li-Yong Rui territory. The total cost, including discount, is about 7.7 MCr. The jump range when fully fueled will show as 37.06 LY in the right hand panel. Background Simulation changes may mean that some modules become unavailable in certain circumstances in Ix. If this happens, Ray Gateway, Diaguandri is reasonably well-stocked. Look for high-tech or large population industrial systems and hopefully you will soon find what you are looking for. \n \n Race Outline ​ The race begins at the megaship ferry in  Synuefe EN-H d11-96  (either  Sadler's Song  or  The Conduit ) or the outpost  The Prospect  in the same system. Be aware that the ferry megaships make their jumps to and from Zende in server downtime on Thursdays. This makes the system easier to reach but you might also find yourself with a trip back to undertake if you are docked on a ship heading back to the Bubble. \nThere is no set course but rather a list of locations where life can be found. It is necessary to map the bodies using the Detailed Surface Scanner to find the locations on planetary surfaces. It is not required to land at a particular signal source location on a life-bearing world. Note that some worlds may have multiple types of life that could count! \nOnce a suitable location has been identified, approach and, if desired, deploy the SRV to scan a life form with the Composition Scanner. Sometimes it can be faster to scan from the ship, sometimes a landing is faster. Be aware of the surface gravity. The Regulation DBX can handle any of the locations provided care is taken on approach and take-off. \nFor Unlimited, pilots may choose  any  locations anywhere they desire! Anything that generates a Codex voucher in the  Organic Structures  section of the Codex is valid, as are  Guardian Sentinels  (from Guardian Objects),  Thargoid Scavengers ,  Thargoid Pods ,  Thargoid Scouts  and  Thargoid Interceptors  (from Thargoid Objects). Note that the short range of the Composition Scanner will result in Thargoid Interceptors turning hostile when scanned. A Shutdown Field Neutraliser will be helpful in dealing with Thargoid Interceptors. \nTo facilitate easier racing for pilots unfamiliar with the region, there is a fixed list of locations for use in the Regulation DBX category, given below - these can be visited in any order. \n \n Synuefe EN-H d11-96 2 (brain trees) and 7a (brain trees and Guardian Structure). The starting system has at least three types of brain tree and Guardian Sentinels are present at the Guardian Structure. \n HIP 38974 1 (bioluminescent anemones) \n Synuefe GI-H d11-52 1a (brain trees) \n Synuefe KZ-F b44-6 1a (brain trees). Roseum and Lividum types found. \n Synuefe NK-E b45-8 C 1 (brain trees) \n Synuefe GI-H d11-5 3 (brain trees) \n Synuefe EN-H d11-27 3 (brain trees) \n Synuefe KV-O c22-20 A 1 (brain trees) \n Synuefe KV-O c22-3 4 (brain trees) \n Synuefe EN-H d11-6 1 (brain trees) \n Synuefe EN-H d11-18 A 3ba (brain trees) \n Synuefe JA-P c22-10 B 1a (brain trees) \n HIP 35524 A 3 (brain trees) \n Synuefe IL-C b46-3 1 Lagrange Cloud (Metallic Crystals and Gourd Molluscs) \n Synuefe MJ-H b43-4 B 1 Lagrange Cloud (Metallic Crystals and Gourd Molluscs) \n HIP 36678 B 1 (bioluminescent anemones) \n HIP 36234 ABC 1 (bioluminescent anemones) \n HIP 35648 1 (bioluminescent anemones) \n Synuefe HE-G b44-5 B 2 (Guardian Structure) \n Synuefe NU-F b44-5 B 1 (Guardian Structure) \n Synuefe EU-Q c21-10 A 3 (Guardian Structure) \n Note that other locations in these systems may harbour life and some worlds may be host to multiple types of life. If you find them, great! (Some long supercruise distances though, which is why only one world per system is given, except for the starting system. Scans from other bodies in these systems are also valid for the Regulation DBX but the time taken to leave the gravity well can be more than leaving the system and going to another location). Remember that the objective is to find at least one unique type of life per world/location, so if you find more at one location, that's good, but you won't get any benefit from, e.g. scanning brain trees of the same type on the same world. If you scan Roseum Brain Trees on one world and then also from another world in the same system, that is OK for the race (although you won't get a Codex voucher for it). Your screenshot/video must make it clear what the life form type is, so use of the ship/SRV lights will be needed in some environments - the night vision view does not provide this information. \nThe race ends on return to the megaship ferry or The Prospect. You can choose to land at a different location than your starting location, as this allows you to avoid an unwanted trip back to the Bubble on the megaship ferry, or to take advantage of it. Note that  only the megaships have large landing pads . \nThe number of scans of life forms within the time limit is your 'score'. If you have scanned all these types before, you should get a 2,500 Cr Codex voucher for each scan, so a quick glance at your left hand panel will tell you how many you have completed. If you have scanned multiple objects of the same class in one system, you will not get the voucher for the later scans (e.g. scanning multiple types of brain tree on one planet) so be sure to have screenshots for each scan that show  'scan completed' . Ideally, these should also show in the top-right info panel what the life form type was or that a voucher was awarded but the info panel does not always wrap in a friendly manner. The view of the life form out the cockpit or canopy view can also help, if lighting conditions are suitable. The  lower-left panel showing the planetary body  and the  location number on that body  is also essential as this will be unique for each site and the  HUD clock must also be visible . \n \n Example \nYou travel to the Lagrange Cloud in Synuefe IL-C b46-3 and scan two types of Metallic Crystals and one Albulum Gourd Mollusc. From this location you have three scans that count. \nNext you travel to Synuefe KZ-F b44-6 1a and make landings at two different sites, scanning Roseum and Lividum Brain Trees. From this location you have two scans that count. If you had visited a third site with Roseum Brain Trees on this world, it would not have counted. A life form counts only one type per location, so you cannot repeatedly scan Brain Trees of the same type at one location. \nFinally you travel to Synuefe EN-H d11-6 1 and scan Ostrinum Brain Trees. You have one scan from this location. \nYou notice that Synuefe EN-H d11-6 2 also has Biological Signals and land in time to get one scan, also of Ostrinum Brain Trees, in the time limit. This might be the same type as from planet 1 but it is a different world, so this scan would also count for the race. \nIn total, this run would net you seven scans, so that would be your score. Your race time would then be used to place you against other racers with the same score. \n \nThe megaships  The Conduit  and  Sadler's Song  jump between the Zende system and Synuefe EN-H d11-96 each week during Thursday server downtime. There is always one megaship in each system. The time remaining to jump is visible when on board and when entering the megaship instance. Note that they do not arrive at the same point in the system! \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n The Prospect is an outpost about 2300 ls from entry into the star system.

To be valid, a run must start in between these times. \nPlease declare an intent to race in this thread, in order that other participants can look out for you on the course. It is not required if you prefer not to, however. Race entries are submitted by sending a PM to me on the Frontier Forums with the following information: \n \n CMDR name \n Race Mode ( Regulation DBX ,  Unlimited \n Game Platform: PC/PS4/Xbox/Other(please state) \n Ship name \n Ship type \n Number of Life Form scans \n Race time \n Link to race evidence (video or screenshots, see below) \n Note on Game Platform: Entries are welcome across all platforms. There will not be separate leaderboards for different platforms unless there are sufficient numbers (at least 5, in order to have a podium and more than one other player chasing a podium place) but the variability in the specifications of PC users is expected to be large enough that players on other platforms should not feel themselves to be competing at a significant disadvantage. For reference, I usually play with a 5-year-old laptop and any disadvantage from that is tiny compared the difference in flying skills between myself and the racers who tend to be vying for the podium places. \nRace Evidence: the following information must be provided by screenshots (taken with the F10 key in-game on PC, console versions have alternative bindings) or be visible on a video. Screenshots can no longer be hosted on the forum and must be uploaded elsewhere (e.g. Imgur or equivalent) and a link provided. Video entries should be uploaded to a suitable video-hosting service (e.g. YouTube or equivalent) and the link provided. Please submit entries within 48 hours of the attempt, if possible. If this is not possible, let me know by forum PM that you are going to be late. There may also be alternative routes to providing the evidence. \n \n Outfitting of the ship showing the Core and Optional Internal modules, with the jump range visible. This is only required for the Regulation DBX. (2 screenshots for Regulation DBX only) \n The ship on the pad, docked, at either the megaship ferry or The Prospect showing the in-game clock: this will be your start time. (1 screenshot) \n The form of life being scanned, with the Scan Completed message visible, along with the HUD clock and the body and location identity in the lower left panel. (1 screenshot per location) (N.B. it will be necessary to use ship/SRV lights to illuminate the life form if in darkness. It needs to be clear which type it is and the night vision view prevents that.). For NSPs, please try to ensure you can uniquely identify the site you took scans from, such as by selecting a celestial body in the system (e.g. the primary star) to compare distances. You do not need to have a life form selected to scan it. \n The ship on the pad, having just docked, at the megaship ferry or The Prospect showing the in-game clock. This will be your finish time. (1 screenshot) \n This requires a total of 2 screenshots, or 4 for the Regulation DBX category, plus one for each site visited, if video is not used. For examples of suitable screenshots when submitting race evidence, see also the Buckyball Racing Club's website. \nIf submitting video evidence, it would be helpful to include times or bookmarks of the pad touchdowns and scans. It is also acceptable to extract screenshots from video footage of your run. \n \n Additional Notes ​ It is permitted to use Guardian technology, such as the FSD booster, in Unlimited only. \nFSD synthesis is not permitted in any mode. \nSupercruise Assist and Docking Computers of any type are not permitted in any mode. \nSupercharging the FSD in the jet cones of white dwarfs and neutron stars is allowed in either mode. \nShips may repair, refuel and restock at any outpost with those facilities. \nShip-to-ship repair and refuel is permitted. \nUse of Multicrew is permitted. Buckyball racing should be considered illegal activity as we don't care about speed limits, reckless flying or the fines involved. \nPlease submit race evidence within 48 hours of making the run if you intend to submit, or else contact me to let me know when you will be able to. Entries submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline for racing will not be considered. Please don't hang on too long, if possible: submit and let people know what you're doing and try to improve later. \nIt is helpful to visit each system first and bookmark the start/finish and waypoints. \nThe time remaining for the megaship ferry to jump between Zende and Synuefe EN-H d11-96 is given when docked or upon entering the megaship instance. \nIt is not required to start with a full fuel tank. \nThe two megaship ferries arrive at different locations in the system, so one may be more advantageous for a particular week. \nIt is not necessary to use the SRV to obtain scans. These can be done from the ship but landing can sometimes be faster. \nIf you want to sell exploration data concerning the 20LY near the starting system, the closest base is just under 200 LY away in the Pencil Nebula (the New Growth asteroid base). \nThe nearest shipyard is also at the New Growth asteroid base. \nAt the time of writing, there is a bug in that some Notable Stellar Phenomena do not always appear. A relog can fix this. \nCertain objects generate additional vouchers when scanned (these show as, e.g., Thargoid Barnacle Scan Data). These only generate a voucher once a week. \nCodex vouchers are turned in via the Authority Contact. \nFor the Regulation DBX class, you can use any sites in the systems listed (the planets given are convenient suggestions, not directives) but not other systems - that's for the Unlimited class. \nThe small fungal growths (e.g. Phloem Extraction) attached to some life forms do not count for scans (but they can be harvested for materials). \nEach numbered biological signal source always contains the same type of life form. \nI did not visit more than three locations on any one world when doing my survey for the race, so I might have missed something! \nHave fun! \n \n Leaderboards ​ \n Regulation DBX ​ \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t

Seals need to be as fast and efficient as they can, so go nuts  \n \n Regulation Class \n This time in a proper maritime themed vessel: The Dolphin. \nIn this class only the following coriolis build is allowed: \n https://s.orbis.zone/5jww Banned: Any engineering, any other modules not listed in the build, any synthesis. \nPlease report if the link is broken. \nNote: You will need to set your power priorities according to the link to make it work, OR turn modules on and off manually. Power managing will be required when dorpping cargo. \n \n Bonus Challenge \n We will be offering a special challenge dedicated to the Hull Seal's call codes. \nThis works as follows: \nIf participants match the conditions corresponding to the call codes at  all  of the checkpoints except for the start, a time bonus will be granted depending on their speed at each checkpoint and the code(s). \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler:  Call Codes \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t These codes are: \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n Hull % 95 - 51 \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nHull % 50 - 11 \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nHull % 10 - 0 \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nBroken Canopy \n\t\t \n\t \n \nOnce the conditions for a valid bonus run are met, time will be substracted from your total as follows: \nsum of speed at each waypoint in meters per second x bonus multiplier = time in seconds to be substracted (rounded up) \nMultipliers are as follows: \nCode Green = 1.0 \nCode Amber = 1.4 \nCode Red = 2.0 \nCode Black = 1.2 \nIn other words: High risk, high reward! \nAnd yes, negative times are a valid possible outcome. \nBonus run times will have their own scoreboard. \n \nQ  &  A \nQ: Why is the Code Black multiplier so low? \nA: Because theoretically you can do it with 100% hull and thus is less risky than a Code Red. \nQ: Can I combine Code Black with another code? \nA: Yes! A Code Black and a Code Amber will result in a 1.6 multiplier for example. \nQ: Can I drop from let's say a Code Green to a Code Amber during the run? \nA: No, you'll have to maintain the same code level throughout your run to get the bonus. \nAny more questions? Feel free to ask. \n \n Tips and Tricks \nNew to racing?

Most video cards have software that will enable video capture without excessive performance impact, for example,  Plays.tv  for AMD,  Shadowplay  for Nvidia, and  Game DVR  for Xbox. \n \nScreenshots are the fastest and lowest bandwidth way to submit your run, but if you wish to upload a full video and link to that instead, that would be great! \nIf you’re feeling kind, please provide timestamps for the start and end screenshot times. \n \nFor both classes you will need the following screenshots: \n1: Docked at Arfstrom Station,  showing 100% Hull \n2: Docked at the station of choice for buying fish \n3: Fish buying screen in the commodity market with 4 tons selected \n4: One ton of fish targeted inside the rings of Arjung 4, day side with the planet name visible \n5. Inside a tunnel of the unauthorized installation with the POI targeted and a repair limpet attached to your hull \n6. Selling screen of fish at Fisher Enterprise in Maya \n7. Docked back at Arfstrom Station, looking towards the back wall/tower (no blowing up to get to the station faster   ) \nMake sure the ingame clock is visible on all screens. \n \nFor video submissions a full, un-edited video of the run will be required. \nIf anything is unsure on how to do this, feel free to ask. Example pics will be provided later (one I find the time to take them) \nFor proof of the bonus challenge: \nScreenshots of passing through the mailslot (can be either entering OR leaving the station, but not both) at checkpoint stations are required, showing your speed, hull % and ingame clock. \nScreenshots of the Fish canister must be taken within 1km distance of it. \nIf you've chosen to use a station that does not have a mailslot for buying your fish, the screenshot must be within 2km of it. \nSubmission form: \n CLOSED \nSubmitted runs will be accepted from Saturday 11th 0:00 CET (my

Buckyball Racing Club, which focuses on SRV sprints away from planetary bases followed by recalling your ship.  This multifarious race tests CDMRs' skills of terrain analysis, SRV driving, planetary ship docking, supercruise planet approaches, knowledge of planetary rotations and eclipses, and hyperjump route-finding. \n \n Vac Lift  has sponsored this race in a bid to keep  Core Dynamics  from replacing their much-maligned SRV suspensions with another part supplier, hoping the bouncing of Buckyballers will be to their benefit. \n \nMay the most cunning CMDR win!

Submit your run using  this form . \n \nIf you achieve podium placement (or just like showing off your ship and SRV) please submit a beauty shot of your ship and SRV (they can be separate shots) \n \n Intent \nIf you wish to register your intent to race, a common format is: \n\n\n\n\n \n\t\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\tIntent to Race/Drive/Crash/Splat/Crush \nCMDR Name \nShip Type (optional) \nRace Class (Unlimited/Regulation) \nShip Name \nSRV Name\n\t\t \n\t\t Click to expand... \n\t \n This allows other competitors to look out for you on the course, add you to their friends list, and generally have a fun time.  but sure to check out the bar at Pond Reach, the Race Marshalls have recently restocked in anticipation of a great turnout! \n \n Staging Area \nVac Lift has kindly sponsored an open bar outside the ship staging area for racers to congregate at and relax before and between their runs. \nPlease try not to entirely trash the place, the Race Marshalls would be disappointed. \nCMDR Alec Turner -  Shaye's Demise  and  Suck It Blackwood \nCMDR Raiko -  The Nomad  and  Bandit-One \nCMDR Arcturus Vermillion -  Honey Badger  and  Possum Van \nCMDR Fish172 =  Crimson Haybaler  and  Celeste  and  Bulletproof Bomb \nCMDR Beth Johanson -  Servant of the Empire  and  Velocitater \nCMDR Codger -  To be determined  and  I Don't Name these \nCMDR JCB Digger -  My Shiny Metal Asp  and  Bob \n \n FAQ \n How do I participate? \nPost your intent here (optional), outfit a ship, run the race, and submit it!  Please let us know if you have any questions, we aim to be as friendly and welcoming as possible.  \n \n Can I start recalling my ship before I reach 7.5 Km from the station? \nYes! This is part of the risk/reward optimization of this race. \nToo soon and you have to backtrack a lot to your ship, or it might even leave; too late and you're losing valuable time. \n \n Do I need engineering to be competitive? \nNo! For racing purists there is a Regulation Classic Cobra Class, which is a Cobra Mk III with unengineered modules, with its own separate scoreboard, leaving everything to skill and cunning, with no spreadsheets necessary (probably). \nFully engineered ships for speed freaks and tuner heads will be racing in the Unlimited Class, which allows all types of engineering (even that creepy Colonia dude) and almost all modules. \n \n I have a console control system, can I race? \nYes! There is a separate column to denote console entries, and if 3 or more entries are made on consoles in either of the categories, a separate podium will be erected. \nIf you have any difficulties recording or screenshotting on a console, please let us know, and we can probably recommend a solution. The same goes for those controlling their ship via the PC platform, or potatoes. We'll do what we can to make it work for you! \n \n Flying is  hard , can I use supercruise assist and a docking computer? \nWe understand the appeal of just letting your Federal Corvette lazily guide itself into the docking bay, but that's not really in line with the Buckyball spirit. In addition, some computer navigation modules can be used in unintended ways, so all flight assist modules are banned from Buckyball Races. \n \n But what about Jumponium? \nIn order to preserve materials for Sagittarius A* runs, all FSD injection is likewise disallowed. \n \n Can I run the Regulation Cobra on the Unlimited Course? \nSure! I suspect it will not place very well on the Unlimited scoreboard though, and there will be no special scoreboard for such an endeavor. \n \n Can I run an Unlimited Class ship on the regulation course? \nI mean you  can , but it will not be a valid race entry, nor will it show up anywhere. \n \n So what do I get if I win? \nBragging rights. \n \nA sense of accomplishment. \n \nTo crush your enemies, seen them falling behind you, and hear the lamentations of their crewmates. \n \nYou know what you get if you win? You might be so lucky as to achieve a Khan meme. Good luck with that.  \n \n So no prizes? \nThere are prizes! Participation prizes! What do I look like, a Boomer?  Wait they gave out participation prizes...  don't answer that. \nAnyone who successfully completes and submits a run will be mailed an official Buckyball Racing club 3 \" x3 \"  Sticker and Magnet. \nYou will need to provide a mailing address to receive these physical items. If you do not feel comfortable providing this via the google form, contact me via the forums or discord to arrange another method. Providing an address is  entirely optional  to submitting a race entry,  you do not have to provide it if you do not want to .  You can submit a race entry without an address.

Buckyball Racing Club Presents: Lava Loop ​ \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t The Buckyball Racing Club website:  http://www.buckyballracing.org.uk \nThe Buckyball Racing Club Discord server:  https://discord.gg/YwxcsCf \n \nThe Lava Loop race showcases some of the hottest places in the Bubble - literally. All the stations are in orbit, some in  very  close orbit, of worlds with seas and oceans of magma, that are even visible on the dark side. The course follows a loop that can be run in either direction to mitigate the problem of obscured jumps, which are expected to be common due to the close orbits. The start and finish point is Conway City in LTT 4961, which is a Coriolis station, but all of the waypoints are outposts, so only small and medium ships are able to participate. \nYou can run the race as many times as you like and try to improve over the duration of the event. If you choose to submit a run for consideration, please do so with 48 hours of that attempt, if possible (see  Submitting a Race Entry ). \n \nThere are two separate race classes: Regulation Hauler and Unlimited. The Regulation Hauler may not be engineered but the build has a jump range of over 30 LY and costs under 500K Cr: is intended to both allow a level playing field and to encourage new players to race. In Unlimited, any small or medium ship with any fittings and engineering can take part, including the use of Guardian FSD boosters. The use of Synthesis for FSD boosting is not allowed in either category but getting a boost from the jet cones of white dwarfs and neutron stars is permissible in both. \nNote that it is not necessary to have Elite: Dangerous: Horizons to participate. Owing to the distances that must be traveled, it is anticipated that the Regulation Hauler build will need at least half an hour to complete the course, though factors such as obscured jumps may affect this. Unlimited times are anticipated to be approximately 20 minutes but could vary significantly by ship, loadout and pilot experience, with the very top pilots possibly completing the course in under 15 minutes in racing-optimised ships. Participants may take part in any play mode they wish but Open play is encouraged in order to meet other racers on the course. \n \n Regulation Hauler build : \n https://s.orbis.zone/4xkq \nThe Hauler and all components of this build can be purchased at the start point, Conway City in LTT 4961. The jump range when fully fueled will show as 30.87 LY in the right hand panel. \n \n Race Outline ​ The race begins at the Coriolis station Conway City in LTT 4961. The Regulation Hauler can be purchased and outfitted here in its entirety, provided that the station is not experiencing an adverse state. The course then proceeds through the following locations in either forward (clockwise) or reverse (anti-clockwise) order: \n \n Hale Orbital, LFT 78. (Outpost) \n Sucharitkul Settlement, GR 316. (Outpost) \n Armstrong Platform, Njunmin. (Outpost) \n Edison Survey, Parcae. (Outpost) \n Levchenko Horizons, LP 617-37. (Outpost) \n The race ends on return to Conway City and the time difference between launch time and touchdown is the race time. \n \nConway City, LTT 4961, is the start and finish line. It is a Coriolis station with all the facilities needed to buy and outfit the Regulation Hauler, making it the only station on the circuit able to support a large class ship, so you can dock here and switch to a smaller ship for racing. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Hale Orbital, LFT 78, is an outpost with facilities to repair, refuel and restock your ship, should they be required. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Sucharitkul Settlement, GR 316, is an outpost that has an Interstellar Factor, in addition to repair, refuel and restock facilities. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Armstrong Platform, Njunmin, is another outpost that is home to an Interstellar Factor.

To be valid, a run must start in between these times. \nPlease declare an intent to race in this thread, in order that other participants can look out for you on the course. It is not required if you prefer not to, however. Race entries are submitted by sending a PM to me on the Frontier Forums with the following information: \n \n CMDR name \n Race Mode ( Regulation Hauler ,  Unlimited ) \n Game Platform: PC/PS4/Xbox/Other(please state) \n Ship name \n Ship type \n Direction (This is clockwise if calling at Hale Orbital first, anti-clockwise if calling at Levchenko Horizons first) \n Race time \n Link to race evidence (video or screenshots, see below) \n Note on Game Platform: Entries are welcome across all platforms. There will not be separate leaderboards for different platforms unless there are sufficient numbers (at least 5, in order to have a podium and more than one other player chasing a podium place) but the variability in the specifications of PC users is expected to be large enough that players on other platforms should not feel themselves to be competing at a significant disadvantage. For reference, I usually play with a 5-year-old laptop and any disadvantage from that is tiny compared to the difference in flying skills between myself and the racers who tend to be vying for the podium places. \n \nRace Evidence: the following information must be provided by screenshots (taken with the F10 key in-game on PC, console versions have alternative bindings) or be visible on a video. Screenshots can no longer be hosted on the forum and must be uploaded elsewhere (e.g. Imgur or equivalent) and a link provided. Video entries should be uploaded to a suitable video-hosting service (e.g. YouTube or equivalent) and the link provided. \n \n Outfitting of the ship showing the Core and Optional Internal modules, with the jump range visible. This is only required for the regulation Hauler. (2 screenshots for Regulation Hauler only) \n The ship on the pad, docked, at Conway City showing the in-game clock: this will be your start time. (1 screenshot) \n The ship on the pad, docked, at each of the outposts above.

(5 screenshots) \n The ship on the pad, docked, at Conway City showing the in-game clock. This will be your finish time. (1 screenshot) \n This requires a total of 7 screenshots, or 9 for the Regulation Hauler mode, if video is not used. For examples of suitable screenshots when submitting race evidence, see also the Buckyball Racing Club's website. \nIf submitting video evidence, it would be helpful to include times or bookmarks of the pad touchdowns. It is also acceptable to extract screenshots from video footage of your run. \n \n Additional Notes ​ It is permitted to use Guardian technology, such as the FSD booster. \nFSD synthesis is not permitted in any mode. \nSupercharging the FSD in the jet cones of white dwarfs and neutron stars is allowed. \nShips may repair, refuel and restock at any outpost with those facilities. \nShip-to-ship repair and refuel is permitted. \nUse of Multicrew is permitted. Buckyball racing should be considered illegal activity as we don't care about speed limits, reckless flying or the fines involved. \nPlease submit race evidence within 48 hours of making the run if you intend to submit, or else contact me to let me know when you will be able to. Entries submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline for racing will not be considered. Please don't hang on too long, if possible: submit and let people know what you're doing and try to improve later. \nIt is helpful to visit each system first and bookmark the start/finish and waypoints. \nArmstrong Platform orbits a planet with one of the most eccentric orbits in the Bubble: the eccentricity is 0.7948, similar to some short-period comets in real life (e.g. Comet Encke has an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.8471) \nThanks to CMDR Alex Turner for help refining the final race banner! \nHave fun! \n \n Final Leaderboards ​ \n Regulation Hauler ​ \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler

livestream series (which starts this Thursday). \n \nThis time trial race runs from now until midnight (galactic time) on Sunday 13th October 3305 and is open to any commander (on any platform). \n \nOn Thursday evening Frontier's Stephen Benedetti and Will Flanagan will both be attempting the race for themselves live so for those who reckon' they can fly better than the FDev community managers - now's your chance to prove it! \n \nThe race takes place around the circuit of 6 stations located approx. 11kls from the main star in the Pareco system. There are two race classes that you can enter -  \" Unlimited \"  (in which you can run in any small or medium ship you like, engineered as much as you like) and  \" Regulation Viper \"  (in which you must use an un-engineered Viper Mk III outfitted as described  here ). Note: the regulation Viper plus all required modules should be available to purchase at Neville Ring. \n \nPrizes will be awarded for the top 3 entries in each class. \n \nTo begin the race get your ship on the landing pad at Neville Ring, facing the mailslot and ready to launch. Wait for a suitable time on the station services clock (I would suggest a time just as the seconds hit  \" 00 \" ), take an in-cockpit screenshot with the clock clearly visible and then launch. Now fly to (and land at) each of the other stations around the Pareco ring in the following order: \n \nNeville Ring  > >  Philips Market  > >  Webb Station  > >  Asire Dock  > >  Crown Orbital  > >  Garden Ring  > >  Neville Ring  > >  etc \n \nTake another screenshot each time you land (making sure the clock is clearly visible in each one). \n \nKeep going around this circuit (in the given order) until 20 minutes have elapsed and then continue on to a final landing at whichever station is next and take a last and final screenshot when the station services menu appears. \n \nNote: competitors in the Regulation Viper class should also take one or more screenshots of their modules to prove they have the correct loadout. \n \nOnce you have your set of screenshots (note: a video of the run is also acceptable) upload them as an album to a suitable image sharing website (people often use IMGUR for this) and then fill in the following web form to complete your submission for the race. \n \n RACE SUBMISSION FORM \n \nThe winner will be the person who makes the largest number of stops around the circuit in the allotted time, and, as a tie breaker for commanders making the same number of stops, the one with the lowest elapsed time over the 20 minutes to their final screenshot. \n \nI'll be maintaining scoreboards for the two race classes in this forum thread throughout the week. You can enter the race as many times as you like over the course of the event so if you want to have another attempt at improving on your run then go for it! \n \nFAQ \n \nQ) What happens if I land just seconds before the 20 minutes are up? \nA) As long as you can get a landing screenshot showing less than 20 minutes since your start then launch again and continue on to the next station before taking your final screenshot. \n \nQ) What happens if I visit the stations in the wrong order? \nA) Only the stations visited in the correct order will count towards your run. Any visited out of order will be discounted. Remember that the stations are in alphabetical order and keep reciting the mantra -  \" Neville, Philips, Web, Asire, Crown, Garden \" . \n \nQ) I keep getting messages saying I need to be closer to request docking permission, what gives? \nA) Because the Pareco stations are all so close to each other the traffic control system can get confused about which station you're requesting permission to land at. Make sure you have the right station selected in the Contacts list first. \n \nQ) The instant I jump into supercruise I get the safe to drop back out again message, what gives? \nA) Again, because the stations are all so close to each other they're all within each other's safe drop zone. Once you've engaged supercruise give it a second or two before trying to disengage again. If you're too quick off the mark it is possible to drop back at the station you just left. \n \nQ) What happens if I buy the farm (i.e. crash and burn) during my run? \nA) I'm afraid the run is over and you will need to start again (this is a relatively short race so let's keep things simple). \n \nQ) Do I need to run in Open mode? (I've heard you guys like that) \nA) I'm not going to mandate that runs must be done in Open mode but, as with all Buckyball Races, I will recommend it. Chances of being ganked during a race are relatively slim (you're meant to be going fast after all plus this race provides almost zero interdiction opportunity) and you never know who you might bump into during a run (sometimes quite literally). With luck a few people will be trying this and racing alongside someone else can be a lot of fun. Note that two of the stations are outposts so there is a danger of having to wait for landing pads. If that becomes a real problem for you then by all means switch to PG or Solo. \n \nQ) Why can't I do my Unlimited run in a large ship? \nA) Because two of the stations are outposts which you wouldn't be able to land at. \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\n\t\n\n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\tJoin the Buckyball Racing Club 3306 Discord Server!\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t Check out the Buckyball Racing Club 3306 community on Discord - hang out with 257 other members and enjoy free voice and text chat. \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tdiscord.gg\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t ","wordList":["note","the","race","is","now","over","welcome","to","full","throttle","at","pareco","buckyball","time","trial","being","run","in","conjunction","with","frontier","new","livestream","series","which","starts","this","thursday","runs","from","until","midnight","galactic","on","sunday","13th","october","3305","and","open","any","commander","platform","evening","stephen","benedetti","will","flanagan","both","be","attempting","for","themselves","live","so","those","who","reckon","they","can","fly","better","than","fdev","community","managers","your","chance","prove","it","takes","place","around","circuit","of","stations","located","approx","11kls","main","star","system","there","are","two","classes","that","you","enter","unlimited","small","or","medium","ship","like","engineered","as","much","regulation","viper","must","use","an","un-engineered","mk","iii","outfitted","described","here","plus","all","required","modules","should","available","purchase","neville","ring","prizes","awarded","top","entries","each","class","begin","get","landing","pad","facing","mailslot","ready","launch","wait","suitable","station","services","clock","would","suggest","just","seconds","hit","00","take","in-cockpit","screenshot","clearly","visible","then","land","other","following","order","philips","market","webb","asire","dock","crown","orbital","garden","etc","another","making","sure","one","keep","going","given","20","minutes","have","elapsed","continue","final","whichever","next","last","when","menu","appears","competitors","also","more","screenshots","their","correct","loadout","once","set","video","acceptable","upload","them","album","image","sharing","website","people","often","imgur","fill","web","form","complete","submission","winner","person","makes","largest","number","stops","allotted","tie","breaker","commanders","same","lowest","ll","maintaining","scoreboards","forum","thread","throughout","week","many","times","course","event","if","want","attempt","improving","go","faq","what","happens","before","up","long","showing","less","since","start","again","taking","visit","wrong","only","visited","count","towards","out","discounted","remember","alphabetical","reciting","mantra","getting","messages","saying","need","closer","request","docking","permission","gives","because","close","traffic","control","confused","about","re","requesting","make","right","selected","contacts","list","first","instant","jump","into","supercruise","safe","drop","back","message","within","zone","ve","engaged","give","second","trying","disengage","too","quick","off","mark","possible","left","buy","farm","crash","burn","during","my","afraid","relatively","short","let","things","simple","do","mode","heard","guys","not","mandate","done","but","races","recommend","chances","ganked","slim","meant","fast","after","provides","almost","zero","interdiction","opportunity","never","know","might","bump","sometimes","quite","literally","luck","few","racing","alongside","someone","else","lot","fun","outposts","danger","having","pads","becomes","real","problem","by","means","switch","pg","solo","why","large","wouldn","able","join","club","3306","discord","server","check","hang","257","members","enjoy","free","voice","text","chat","gg"]},{"name":"HOT OFF THE PRESS","author":"Alec Turner","date":"17.08.3305","dateDate":"3305-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","infoUrl":"https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-buckyball-racing-club-presents-hot-off-the-press-17th-to-25th-august-3305.518869/","bannerImage":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614732620131205135/618095683546775552/hot_off_the_press_banner.png","extractedInfo":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n Do you have what it takes to become a photojournalist? ​ \nAs  a  member  of  our  highly  skilled  photojournalism  team,  not  only  do  you  need  to  be  able  to  take  excellent  photographs, but you also need to be able to use your investigative skills to know where to get the perfect shot and be capable of getting to those locations quickly and efficiently. After all, today’s news is tomorrow’s history, and you’re not applying for the role of history correspondent! \n \nTo begin the test, dock your ship at the Print Works in the Millese system, appropriately outfitted for the task ahead but carrying no cargo. When you’re ready to go — and have completed all necessary research — return to the surface and take a screenshot which clearly shows the clock at the Station Services screen. Now, as fast as you can, head out to locations providing photo opportunities for one item from each of the following six groups, in whatever order seems best to you: \n \n \n Group #1 \n \n A Federal or Imperial capital ship \n Another ship using lasers to mine an asteroid \n Flying through a Buckyball holo-ad \n Group #4 \n \n Something Guardian (not human hybrid technology) \n A Coriolis with “noob hammers” \n A black hole \n Group #2 \n \n In the SRV at an altitude over 250m \n Inside a burning (or repairing) station \n A brain tree, space pumpkin or bark mound \n Group #5 \n \n A shipwreck (human) \n A geyser or fumarole \n Some form of space-bound Stellar Phenomena \n Group #3 \n \n Something Thargoid \n A ship exploding \n An asteroid explosion \n Group #6 \n \n An outpost ship showroom \n An abandoned or wrecked SRV \n An INRA logo \n \n \nOnce  you’ve  got  the  shots,  return  to  The  Print  Works  and  take  another  screenshot  of  the  clock  immediately  upon landing. This is your closing time. \n \nAll screenshots must be in-cockpit with the HUD clock visible. Note that it may be possible to satisfy several objectives at the same location. Creative thinking is encouraged. \n \nWhen  you  have  completed  the  task,  submit  your  portfolio  of  screenshots  to  the  adjudicator  who  will  assess  your performance and rank you alongside the other applicants. \n \n The test runs from 00:00 Saturday 17th Aug 3305 until 23:59 Sunday 25th Aug 3305 UTC. ​ \n Best of luck, Commander! \n \n Please note : this is not a real application to join the Sagittarius Eye team. \n Sincere photojournalism enquiries should be made to  photography@sagittarius-eye.com . \n \n \n \nOK, so that's the scoop courtesy of  Sagittarius Eye  issue #24 but here are a few more details: \n \nYour race submissions should be made using the following Google form: \n \n HOT OFF THE PRESS - RACE SUBMISSION FORM ​ \nEach submission should include 9 screenshots in total: one of your Inventory tab on the right-hand panel showing that you're carrying no cargo at the start, one showing the station services clock just before you launch from The Print Works (your start time), one for each of the groups you've selected above (each in-cockpit with the HUD clock visible) and one of the station services clock back at the Print Works after you've landed (your finish time). \n \nAny ship may be used for your photography assignment and engineering is allowed. Buckyball Races would normally have two classes, Unlimited and Regulation, however in this instance, since it's highly unlikely that any two pilots will be following the same route, the need for a class where everyone is on an equal footing seems somewhat redundant. \n \nClarifications of photo opportunities: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \" Flying through a Buckyball holo-ad \"  - this means a shot taken just before (so it's still possible to make out which advert it is) you fly through one of the holo-ad's shown below:\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \" Inside a burning station \"  - this is a shot taken anywhere inside a Thargoid attacked burning space station. You don't need to land, just fly in, take the shot and fly out again. Note: since there are currently no burning stations I've extended this category to include a photograph of a  \" restricted access \"  pad inside a repairing station. \n \n \" Something Thargoid \"  - anything solid will do, as long as it's obviously Thargoid in nature. Not the green mist around things like bases and attacked ships, not the green signs of caustic damage visible on assets the Thargoids have attacked and not Thargoid wakes. In other words, signs that Thargoids were here - not allowed, something actually Thargoid - allowed. Oh, and not the Thargoid bobblehead! \n \n \" A ship exploding \"  - that's an actual explosion happening, any ship (player or NPC) will do. \n \n \" Something Guardian \"  - again, anything physical and obviously Guardian in nature. Not human hybrid technology (i.e. you can't just take a shot of your own Guardian hybrid ship launched fighter) and not the Guardian cockpit lights either! \n \n \" A black hole \"  - the star's lensing effect must be clearly visible in the shot, it's not sufficient to simply target a dot in the distance which happens to be a black hole. \n \n \" A shipwreck (human) \"  - this must be a ship (i.e. not an SRV) but any clearly crashed, wrecked or derelict ship (planetside or in space) other than capital ships will do. It should be a permanent wreck (i.e. not the remains of your explosion from group #3 for example). \n \n \" An outpost ship showroom \"  - for those that haven't encountered these before they have an area with a glass roof through which you can clearly see an array of Eagles and other ships lined up. \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \" An abandoned or wrecked SRV \"  - this should clearly be the body of an SRV and not just something like a single wheel. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n Screenshot competition! \n \nAs well as the main race I'm also planning to run a screenshot competition here in this forum thread. So, if you find yourself with a stunning photo opportunity and want to risk adding a few seconds to your run then go to external camera, compose a proper screenshot (this is a photo journalism event after all) and post it in the thread. \n \n FAQ \n \nQ) Are you allowed to reconfigure your ship during the race? \nA) Yes - you can even change ships mid-course if you think that will help. \n \nQ) Will you accept video evidence? \nA) Reluctantly, yes. If you're going to video your run (which is a great idea incidentally as it means you can pick the perfect moment for your screenshots at your leisure later) then I'd prefer you to then grab the appropriate set of screenshots from it but if you really really want to just upload the whole video and send the link to that instead then yeah, OK - I guess. \n \nQ) Do you get any bonus if the black hole screenshot is of Sagittarius A*? \nA) There won't be any tangible time bonus but, as with all Buckyball Races, going above and beyond the requiremements will always get you recognition and kudos in the Buckyball annals of fame. This includes things like doing the race in a wholly inappropriate type of ship. \n \nQ) Do I need to race in any particular game mode? \nA) The Buckyball Racing Club actively encourage people to fly in Open mode. This way there's the increased chance of bumping into (sometimes literally) other racers doing the same (which is always fun) plus you get the opportunity to tell other players you encounter along the way what you're doing (and maybe even encourage them to have a go too). The chance of being  \" griefed \"  during a race is minimal and we strongly believe it's worth the risk. But - if you're really averse to this then there's nothing in the rules (of this race at least) to say you can't run in private or solo. \n \nQ) How close do we need to get to  < insert-thing-here > ? \nA) Basically close enough for it to be clearly recognisable to the adjudicator as the item in question. See also the clarification above on black holes. \n \nQ) Will pictures taken from the SRV also be acceptable? \nA) Yes, pictures can be taken from either inside the ship or inside the SRV (HUD clock should be visible in either case). \n \nQ) Is using a second account an acceptable loophole? \nA) Not really, no. I feel this falls into the much derided area of  \" pay to win \"  so, although it might be difficult for me to prove you've done it - I would urge you not to. \n \nIf you have any further questions (I've almost certainly forgotten to mention something incredibly important) then do please ask in the thread. If you feel the question is going to giveaway your tactics to the other racers (or if you just want to check whether your cunning plan is going to break, or merely bend the rules then send me a pm).

Raiko as he carried his glass of Indi Bourbon over to the battered corner table where his old friend sat. \n \n \" Kligg. \" \n \n \" Raiko, long time no see. \" \n \nSitting down Raiko glanced across at the old chalkboard over the bar, the words hadn’t changed since five years ago: \n \n Under 20 mins: Double Centauri Mega Gin with a Bast Sanke Gin chaser followed by a Alacarakmo Skin Art tattoo of Bucky's face on your back! \n20-22 minutes: Lavian Brandy and a Kamitra Cigar \n22-24 minutes: Haiche Black Brew and a packet of Karsuki Locusts \n24-26 minutes: Kongga Ale \n26-28 minutes: Gerasian Gueuze Beer \n28-30 minutes: Leestian Evil Juice \nOVER 30 minutes: You, sir / madam, are buying the drinks! \n \nRaiko chuckled as he remembered the event,  \" We nearly bankrupted the joint back in '01. Get many entries these days? \" \n \nKligg shook his head sadly,  \" Nah, kids these days don't know how to race, too busy grinding stuff. Even send out angry comms messages if they spot anyone speeding in the dock. \" \n \n \" Ahh, well we were thinking of starting up the BRC again, teach the kids how to fly fast. \" \n \n \" That why you came here Raiko? \"  anger flashed in Kligg's eyes,  \" You know I'm done with racing! \" \n \nRaiko just smiled as he sat back, taking a sip of bourbon,  \" Nope, I came here to ask if you'd mind if we borrowed your old race? Ran a proper old-style Buckyball race from here to the sisters and back? They've got stations in most of those systems now, the one in Atlas is too far out for fun racing, but there's plenty of usable ones. \" \n \n \" A proper old school Buckyball race, like Buckyball-7? \" \n \n \" Yeah, that's what we were thinking. \" \n \n \" With no shenanigans? \" \n \n \" Well, you know a lot of us like some shenanigans in the races. \" \n \n \" No way! \"  Kligg thumped the table,  \" A real Buckyball Race doesn't need any shenanigans! Electric-Z never needed no shenanigans. \" \n \nRaiko sits quietly for a moment, waiting for his friend to calm down,  \" Well I'm not sure that that's true, but okay, just a Buckyball race... \" \n \n \" With no shenanigans? \" \n \n \" ...with no shenanigans, gotcha. \" \n \nGrinning Raiko stood up to leave,  time to get the word out . \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n It's just a Buckyball Race... \n \nIn August 3301 the BRC hosted an event – the Pleiades Hip Hop – involving a run from Ohm Horizons at the edge of the bubble to each of the Seven Sisters – the most prominent stars of the Pleiades Nebula – and back to the bubble. At that time there were no stations or human installations in the Pleiades and so the event involved  \" Hip Hopping \"  between the seven stars collecting an evidence screenshot from each and then docking back at Ohm Horizons. The premise of the race was a standing bar challenge to make it to the Seven Sisters and back in less than thirty minutes for free drinks, if you took more than thirty minutes, you bought the drinks! \n \nThings have changed a lot in the Pleiades since then, indeed Electric-Z and Bucky organised Buckyball-9 to celebrate the opening of the first Pleiades station – a race across the full width of the bubble and ending at Obsidian Orbital. \n \nAlien sites were discovered in the Pleiades, and so the BRC organised a race to  \" Kick an Alien \"  and then run for it, what could possibly go wrong? Well the Bubble burns as Thargoid warships raid systems across human space, but at least the race was fun! \n \nSo, Buckyball racers have a long history of fun in the Pleiades Nebula, and so it seemed fitting after our brief break from racing to return to the route of one of our original events and see it the high performance ships of 3305 can race to the Pleiades and back in less than thirty minutes, but this time visiting a few of the stations and installations of the Seven Sisters in typical Buckyball Style. \n \nThe race begins at 00:00:01GMT Saturday 13-JUL-3305. \n \nThe Seven Sisters are: \n \n Asterope \n Atlas \n Celaeno \n Maia \n Merope \n Pleione \n Sterope II \n Classes: \n \nThe Seven Sisters Speedway has the following classes: \n \n Open Unlimited Class \n Regulation Hauler Class \n Regulation Hauler Class: \nFor this class, you  must  use the following build: \n \n https://s.orbis.zone/3q2a \n \nThat is: \n \n Class A Thrusters and FSD \n All other core modules class D \n Fuel tank : 2 ton \n Class 3C Fuel Scoop \n No other optional modules, hardpoints or utilities. \n All parts are normally available at Ohm Horizons. \n \n Engineering is  BANNED \n Guardian Tech is  BANNED \n Jumponium synthesis is  BANNED \n White dwarf / neutron star FSD supercharging is  PERMITTED \n Open Unlimited Class: \n \nFor this class, you may used  any build , subject to the rules below: \n \n Standard  &  Advanced Docking Computers are  BANNED \n Supercruise Assist is  BANNED \n Engineering is  PERMITTED \n Guardian Tech is  PERMITTED \n Jumponium synthesis is  BANNED \n White dwarf / neutron star FSD supercharging is  PERMITTED \n The Course \n \nBegin the race docked at  Ohm Horizons   in  HIP 29312 . \n \nVisit the following nine locations in the Pleiades Nebula in any order: \n \n Asterope – Dock at  Copernicus Observatory  (83ls) \n Atlas – Hip Hop only! \n Celaeno – Dock at  Artemis Lodge  (46ls) \n Maia – Dock at  Obsidian Orbital  (635ls) \n Merope – Make a fly-past of the  Listening Post  orbiting Merope-1b (2100ls) – Note: listening posts, like other space structures, only appear on your Nav Panel when you approach to within 1000ls. \n Pleione – Dock at  Stargazer  (1072ls) \nAND \n Pleione – Make two tunnel fly-throughs at the  Squirrel's Nest  space bar (265ls) \n Sterope II – Hip Hop only! \n Then return to dock at  Ohm Horizons  in  HIP 29312 . \n \n Evidence: \n \n Start Line – Your start time is the displayed time and date, on the landing pad at  Ohm Horizons , before you select launch. \n Docking – Your docking screenshot must show the time and date, on the landing pad \n Hip Hop only! – Take a screenshot while in system, with both the clock and the system / star name displayed  OR  take a screenshot of the GalMap showing your current location and the time  &  date. \n Finish line – Your finish time is the displayed time and date, on the landing pad back at  Ohm Horizons . \n Tunnel fly-throughs at  Squirrel's Nest  – Your two screenshots must show that you are inside the  tunnel  and your  cockpit clock  must be visible. \n Listening Post  fly-past in  Merope  – Your screenshot must show that you are within  250m  of the listening post, additionally  Merope 1b  must be displayed in the bottom left corner of the HUD. Finally the time must be visible – either the  cockpit clock , or if making a Kamikaze Cup run, the time of your transmitted message. \nNote there are two possible distances to the listening post: the nav-marker and the distance to target if the LP is selected. Either will do. \n That Listening Post (images in spoiler tags): \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The correct Listening Post is selected and is orbiting the moon Merope-1B \nThe incorrect Listening Post is visible over to the right 0.11ls away. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \nThe correct Listening Post is selected in the Nav panel below, inset below Merope-1B \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \nThe screenshot below shows distances of 130m (Nav Marker) and 143m (selected target) to the Listen Post (either is valid). Merope 1B is displayed bottom left, and for Kamikaze Cup evidence a speed of 855m/s and a message time of 23:43 are displayed. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nNote that for a video recording submission, you don't need to get everything into shot at the same time. Just fly within 250m -  fast and after transmitting the message in the case of a Kamikaze Cup run. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n ...with no shenanigans! \n \nOkay, so everyone loves a few shenanigans, some commanders even love to find ways to register negative times for their runs. And no one loves a few shenanigans more than long time Buckyball fan Enoch  \" Little Nuk \"  Lonnigan. And so alongside the Open Unlimited and Regulation Hauler classes of the Seven Sisters Speedway, commanders will also be able to try and win Nuk's Kamikaze Cup: \n \nEarn time bonuses by flying really fast through checkpoints such as station entrances and space bar tunnels, can you balance velocity against overshot and explosion skillfully enough to earn the lowest adjusted time and claim the Kamikaze Cup? \n \n Just don't tell Kligg... \n \n The Kamikaze Cup Rules \n \n All repairs are  banned  during a Kamikaze Cup Run – so remember to repair before starting! \n \nReceive a time bonus for each m/s in your two  Squirrels Nest   tunnel run screenshots and in your   listening post  flypast screenshot. \n \nFor the listening post screenshot to be valid, as well as being within 250m of the listening post you must have posted the message  \" There's fast and then there's Buckyball \"  to the local message channel. It'll confuse the hell out of those xeno-watchers! \n \nSpread the word Commanders! \n \nAdditionally take a screenshot  inside   each station that you dock at, prior to docking, including  Ohm Horizons . You will receive a time bonus for each m/s of velocity in each of your pre-docking screenshots (maximum of 5x screenshots). Inside the cage will do. \n \nFor Kamikaze Cup runs it is strongly advised to make a video recording of your run, to either upload or extract the best screenshots from, this will allow you to take the highest speed during each tunnel run and make the other screenshots much easier to record. \n \nYou do not need to submit all 8 time bonus screenshots for a valid Kamikaze run (even 1 will give a time bonus). \n \nIf you submit a video recording as evidence, then I'll try to get the fastest valid speed at each checkpoint. \n \nSo you can accumulate bonus time from up to 8 checkpoints: \n \n Tunnel fly-through #1 at  Squirrel's Nest . \n Tunnel fly-through #2 at  Squirrel's Nest . \n Listening Post  fly-past near  Merope 1B \n Docking at  Copernicus Observatory \n Docking at   Artemis Lodge \n Docking at  Obsidian Orbital \n Docking at  Stargazer \n Docking at  Ohm Horizons \n The speeds of all 1-8 checkpoints will be added together. \nThen this percent of a minute will be deducted from your run time. Fractions of a second will be rounded up unless need to split a tie. \nE.g. \n \n If you like to  \" fly Cmdr Daisy \"  and pass through all 8 checkpoints at  100m/s , you will receive a total time bonus of  800%  of a minute, or  08m00s . And so  08m00s  will be deducted from your Kamikaze Cup run time. \n If you pass through each checkpoint at  711m/s , you will receive a total time bonus of  5688%  of a minute, or  56m52.8s . And so  56m53s  will be deducted from your Kamikaze Cup run time. \n Negative adjusted times are  valid ; the lowest adjusted time wins the Kamikaze Cup. \n \n \n What is Buckyball Racing? \n \nQuoting from the  BRC website : \n \n The aim of Buckyball-style races is to be as inclusive as possible. The features of these races are:  \n \n In systems accessible to all - no permit-locked systems \n Can be run at any time - time-trial / checkpoint-style races, that can be run at any time within the race period, and thus open to those in all time zones \n OK to run repeatedly - part of the excitement is trying to improve on your time! \n Open to any ship - this normally means no outposts as that would rule out large ships, but certain events will include outposts and thus cannot be run with larger ships; check the rules of each event \n Events run by the BRC are inspired by the Buckyball Run, a series of point-to-point time trials organised by Commander Electric-Z and Bucky, the fastest kangaroo in the galaxy. \n \n \n Frequently Asked Questions \n \nHere is a set of FAQs to help out: \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t How many times can I enter? \n \nYou can make as many runs as you wish during the race week, but only your best valid run will appear on each leader board. So the most leader board spots you can have is three, one-each for Open Unlimited and Regulation Hauler classes, and one for Nuk's Kamikaze Cup. Half the fun of Buckyball racing is seeing your time improve during the event. \n \n So does my Kamikaze Cup entry have to be made separately? \n \nNo, you can enter any qualifying Open Unlimited or Regulation Hauler class run into the Kamikaze Cup if you like, or you can make a separate run especially for the cup, it's up to you. Remember that repairs are banned during Kamikaze Cup runs though; and that you need to transmit your BRC message to the listening post to gain that time bonus. \n \n I'm on console, is this just for PC cmdrs? \n \nNo, Buckyball events are open to cmdrs on all platforms. The nice thing about our time-trial format and the shared universe, is that runs are generally balanced across platforms, time-zones and play-modes. \n \n So is Open Unlimited class for open mode only? \n \nNo, it's open to all ships with a few module restrictions. You can play in any game-mode, but we do encourage participants to give open mode a go for our events. Most BRC regulars race in open-mode and it's nice to meet fellow racers out on the course. Most of us have destroyed so many of our own ships crashing into stations, that we're not worried about other cmdrs shooting at us, and pvp attacks have been very-very rare during our events anyway . \n(Unlike those pesky npc 'griefers' who never fail to spoil a personal-best run with an interdiction attempt 1.1Mm from the last station!) \n \n Do I need Horizons to enter this event? \n \nNot to the best of my knowledge. All checkpoints are space based stations and installations, or just stars in the case of two destination systems. So I believe this race is fully accessible to players of the base game. \n \n Which modules are allowed? \n \nIn Regulation Hauler class you must use the build specified. In Open Unlimited class and Nuk's Kamikaze Cup the following modules are banned: Docking Computer, Advanced Docking Computer, Supercruise Assist. All other modules are legal. \n \n What about Guardian Technology? \n \nAll guardian tech, including the FSD Booster is legal in Open Unlimited and the cup. Ships with an with FSD boosters will be noted though, so it's still worth entering open-unlimited even without access to guardian technology. \n \n Can I use FSD fuel boost synthesis? \n \nNo, FSD synthesis is banned before and during a run. \n \n Can I boost using white dwarfs / neutron stars? \n \nYes, FSD supercharging is allowed, so if there's a dead star in a convenient location, dive in there and get a boost. \n \n Can I repair / refuel at stations? \n \nYes, but ship repairs are banned during a Kamikaze Cup run. \n \n Can I swap ships / modules during a run? \n \nNo the ship configuration you begin a run with must remain unchanged during that run. \n \n I love those Lonnigan brothers and I'm glad to see that Little Nuk has made it, but where the heck is Fat Tony? \n \nFat Tony is busy seeing if he can fix the Black Riband without needing to reboot it again. He'll be watching the action on the GalNet Sports Network though (via pirate stream of course). \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n Intent to Race! \n \nIs it customary (but not required) for Buckyballers to declare their intent to race before doing so, in something like the following format. \n \n Intent to Race \nCMDR Name (forum alias if different) \n Ship name  (ship type) \nRace Class \n \nExamples: \n Intent to Race \nCMDR Raiko \n The Nomad  (Asp X) \nOpen Unlimited \n \n Intent to Explode \nCMDR Raiko \n Buckyball XL-5  (Hauler) \nRegulation Hauler and Kamikaze Cup \n \n \n Proof and Submissions: \n \nPlease PM me on here with your run times (use the  \" conversation \"  envelope at the top of the screen): \n \nFormat: \nCMDR Name (forum alias if different) \n Ship name  (ship type) \nRace Class and/or Kamikaze Cup \nStart Time: hh:mm:ss \nFinish Time: hh:mm:ss \nURL Link to Evidence Screenshots or Video Upload \n \nScreenshots are the fastest and lowest bandwidth way to submit your run, but if you wish to upload a full video and link to that instead, that would be great! \nIf you’re feeling kind, please provide timestamps for the start and end screenshot times. \n \nIf you enter the  Kamikaze Cup , there's no need to work out your time bonuses yourself, just include the required additional screenshots, or I'll extract the best bonuses from your video upload. \n \n Please don't link to your video uploads or screenshots in forums post or post your run times until the final weekend of the event. In the traditional Buckyball style, I'll be obfuscating precise run times until the last few days of the race. \n \n \nP.S. Why not join us in the BRC Discord for live chat before, during or after making a run! \n \n \n \n

Previously: \n \n \n'So, ship racing, eh? Where do kids race today? \n \n' \" Buckyball Racing \" ? Ah, guess I've heard of that. Aren't those these hotheads which appeared a few years back?  \" Mischief Mile \" ,  \" Kessel Run \" , yeah? Thought so. \n \n'You know, I've been doing quite a bit of racing in my time. Was different back then. We didn't have these fancy frameshift drives. Took a week to go just a dozen light-years. And anyone exceeding 30 million meters per second got a nice badge. Heh. \n \n'What races we did? Ah, you ever heard of the Wiccan Ware Race? That was the big one. Nothing compared to that. People prepared years just for that. Dangerous, too. People got shot, 'cause nobody checked. \n \n'Basically went from Gateway to Alioth. Had to have a ship which could do it in a single jump and then do a number on your thrusters for the leg in-system. They started to include a stint to Soholia after some sort of medical emergency and a bunch of racers helping out. Good thing, too. They could use some good press. \n \n'What's become of it? Eh, don't know. They were still going when I quit. But haven't heard much about it since some time. Who knows? Might still be going.' \n \n'Thank you, sir. This has been really interesting.' \n \n \n \n'Ladies and Gentlemen, please allow me to be blunt. Dreamware is past its golden days. Nobody uses Stardreamer anymore and all you have left are contracts with a few semi-retired bands more known for nostalgia than anything else. A new Jjagged Bbanner compilation every few years doesn't cut it anymore.' \n \n'What are you talking about. We are the biggest label in the Alliance, we generate solid profits year after year. I believe we are doing just fine.' \n \n'Well, granted, your base is solid. Yet. But how long until some Imperial Label sees the time come to expand into Alliance Space? Do you think you have any chance to resist even just one of them?' \n \n'Be so kind and leave that to us. Anyway, what do you suggest?' \n \n'What you need is new blood. Dreamware must become the first choice producer for young talent again. You must return into people's consciousness. What you need, is news.' \n \n'What, you want us to raise some scandal or the like? I very much hope I'm misunderstanding.' \n \n'No, no scandals. Dreamware used to be known for daring publicity stunts, for being active outside music business. What I am talking about is the Wiccan Ware Race. I want to help you, to bring it back.' \n \n'What are you talking about, bringing it back? Dreamware held a Wiccan Ware Race one year ago. It was an astounding success. The number of accidents was at an all-time low.' \n \n'Well, it's easy to have few accidents if nobody participates.' \n \n'What did you say?' \n \n'Show me one Galnet article, or even one from the Herald mentioning the Wiccan Ware Race. It's been forgotten. Nobody talks about it. All that's left are some youngsters from Alioth who want to take Mama's new ship for a spin. Nobody takes it serious anymore. But I want to help you change that. I want to bring the Wiccan Ware Race back to the forefront of ship racing.' \n \n'So, what are you suggesting?' \n \n'Have you ever heard of the Buckyball Racing Club?' \n \n \n \n'No! No! No! You are talking about taking the soul out of the Wiccan Ware Race. For over one hundred years, the finish was in Alioth. This is about bringing culture to the cultural heart of the Alliance, after all.' \n \n'To be honest, personally, I don't consider Jjagged Bbanner a highlight of Alliance culture, but that might just be me.' \n \n'It doesn't matter. This race has a century-long tradition we have to respect.' \n \n'But we are trying to attract today's racing elite. And they don't want Alioth.' \n \n'Then they should learn to want it. It should be an honour to race in memory of Wiccan Ware and Soholia.' \n \n'About that, by the way. We're going to change the name back to  \" Wiccan Ware Race \" .' \n \n'What? Why?' \n \n'Because  \" The Soholia Relieve Memorial Event in Remembrance of the Heroes of the Wiccan Ware \"  is – among other things – too long for any poster.' \n \n'Well, to be fair, I never liked that name either.' \n \n'See, not all change is bad.' \n \n'Oh, one thing: That logo on your advertisement material …' \n \n'Which one?' \n \n'That one.' \n \n'Oh, that's the Buckyball logo.' \n \n'Are you affilliated with said Buckyball?' \n \n'Well, no. But all ship races these days use this logo.' \n \n'That's probably because all ship races these days involve this Buckyball Racing Club.' \n \n'You sure about that?' \n \n'Pretty sure, yeah!' \n \n'And that means?' \n \n'You can't just use somebody else's logo and put it into you advertisement. That's prohibited pretty much everywhere!' \n \n'Ah, it can't be that bad.' \n \n'Yes, it is that bad. If you want to use the logo, you better have this race organised by them. If not, remove it.' \n \n'But, without that logo nobody will participate!' \n \n'So?' \n \n'Ok, ok, I call them.' \n \n'You better! Anyway, about Alioth …' \n \n'Ugh …' \n \n \n \n'Ladies and Gentlemen. Fasten your seat-belts. The race is on again! \n \n'In the name of Dreamware and the Buckyball Racing Club I am honoured to announce the 3305 edition of the Wiccan Ware Race, lasting from 12 to 22 January 3305. \n \n'Dreamware, always at the forefront of bringing entertainment to its consumers has joined a partnership with the well-known authority of ship racing, the Buckyball Racing Club, in order to introduce this century old tradition to a new generation of racing enthusiasts all around inhabited space (excluding Colonia). \n \n'Never shy of change while keeping memory of the Heroes of Soholia alive, we have introduced careful adjustments to the course to bring a fresh spin to our viewers' enjoyment. Here goes for another century! \n \n'(Tickets are available at all Interstellar Factors.)'

The Buckyball Racing Club's Discord server ( https://discord.gg/8gg2S5z ) and website ( http://www.buckyballracing.org.uk ) provide helpful information on entering a race and hints and tips for improving your flying skills. \n. \n Race Outline ​ The race starts with participants on the edge of the ramp that passes through the wall of the ringed surface city Koolhaas' Folly. The wheels of the SRV should not be touching the ramp. An example of an acceptable starting position is shown here: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n The first leg of the triathlon is to race from this position to the centre of the crater adjacent to the city. The target co-ordinates are: \nlatitude: 30.6568 degrees \nlongitude: 24.8607 degrees \nThere is no particular marker for these co-ordinates, which are 20.0 km away from the city, so arriving within 0.0020 degrees of both the target latitude and longitude is acceptable. There is also a slim chance of a temporary POI appearing at the target location, so exact positioning is not needed but these co-ordinates are compatible with a landing location for the Keelback so getting close to them may be helpful. Koolhaas' Folly is located on the dark side of a tidally-locked planet so the course is in perpetual night. The surface gravity of HIP 73293 3 is 1.12g. To assist participants in finding their way, this is part an old screenshot showing the city and the nearby crater from a time when the surface would be artificially brightened: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n As the image shows, the heading required to reach the target co-ordinates from Koolhaas' Folly is approximately 165. Once arrived at the target location, it is necessary to recall the mother ship to then fly to either Gridge or Larg. \nThe course can be run in either direction: HIP 73293, Gridge and Larg are all approximately 100 LY away from each other. In the regulation Keelback loadout, this will be from four to six jumps for each leg depending on your filtering options and direction of travel. Neutron star and white dwarf boosting are allowed in all classes, although I have not seen any close enough to the route for them to be useful. If racing as a multicrew team (see below), then the Ship-launched fighter (SLF) pilot should join the ship after departing HIP 73293, as they will be required to fly all the SLF sections. \nAt Larg, the objective is to fly a SLF through the ring of either of the two Majestic class Interdictors berthed at the Capital Ship Dock adjacent to Kagawa Survey, in orbit of the planet AB 1 (see image below). The Capital Ship Dock is located just within the no-fire zone of the station but appears as a separate location on the navigation panel in supercruise. It does not have an exclusion zone so you will not incur fines from flying close to the ships berthed there. After flying through the ring, return to the mother ship and dock the SLF.  If you destroy the SLF during this, or any other, leg then you will have to repeat the leg . This will mean a short wait whilst the Fighter Hangar 'prints' a new fighter. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n At Gridge 1, the objective is to fly a SLF into any of the tunnels of the Military Installation and then return to the mother ship. There is a no-fly zone within 4.5 km around the installation and it is crawling with turrets, so to survive it is necessary to be quick! In the screenshot above, it can be seen that there is a narrow passage through one of the structures which may be easier to use but any tunnel, even one with a dead end, will do - just be sure you can get out again quickly! There is no guarantee the mother ship will not be targeted by the turrets if a bounty is incurred. (An Interstellar Factor is available at Dyson Orbital in the Mandubii system, if required). \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Upon returning to Koolhaas' Folly, the final challenge is to fly the SLF through the tunnel through the wall around the city, then return to the mothership and dock the mothership at Koolhaas' Folly. Unlike some ringed cities, there is only the one tunnel here but it is large enough to accommodate any current SLF, including the new Guardians fighters. Note that it is necessary to be outside the city's no-fire zone (about 8.8 km) to deploy the fighter. This is the toughest of the SLF challenges as the road through the perimeter wall is not straight but arches and the surface gravity of 1.12 g makes traversing this passage cleanly at speed very difficult (there's a reason why I took the screenshot below at a speed of just 51 m/s!). Expect to blow up a few fighters here! The race ends when the mothership docks at Koolhaas' Folly. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Race Modes ​ Triangle Triathlon has three modes:  Regulation Keelback ,  Single Unlimited , and  Multicrewed . Depending on participation, Multicrewed may be split into  Multicrewed Regulation Keelback  and  Multicrewed Unlimited . \n Regulation Keelback  requires the following loadout, with  any  model of Taipan SLF (not all are the same but choose whichever you prefer): \n https://s.orbis.zone/dgv \nThe Keelback and most of the modules can be obtained from Arai Orbital, Nungk, with the remaining modules (Power Plant, Fuel Scoop and Sensors) available at Check Port, Chere. Where outfitting is available, it is usually possible to buy Taipan and GU-97 SLFs in this region even if Fighter Hangars are not sold. Arai Orbital stocks all three types of human fighter (the nearest Guardians Tech Broker that I know of is at Smoot Orbital, Chona). This loadout is expensive for a regulation loadout, at over 5.7 million credits, so participants might wish to obtain the ship and modules elsewhere: with the Li Yong-Rui 15% discount the total price is just under 5 million credits. \n Single Unlimited  allows any SLF-capable ship with any Engineering modifications but it is prohibited to use Guardians Frame Shift Boosters or FSD boost synthesis. Any model of SLF can be used, including the AX Taipan and the Guardians fighters, but the Fighter Hangar must be a class 5: this ensures that there is a fixed time penalty for blowing up a SLF and that the same SLF is used throughout a run. \n Multicrewed  efforts follow the above rules but with a human SLF pilot flying all the sections that require the SLF. Note that it is necessary to wait until the SRV section has been completed before the SLF pilot can join the ship via multicrew. Each team of mothership + SLF pilot will only get one entry on the leaderboard, so if the two players swap roles on subsequent attempts, only the best time will appear on the leaderboard. It is therefore possible for a single Commander to appear multiple times on the leaderboard by flying SLFs for other competitors or hosting different SLF pilots.  Pilots invite other Commanders aboard their ship at their own risk!  There is a chance of committing crimes during the race... \nIt is suggested that all entrants compete in Open so that they might meet other racers taking part but it is not a requirement. Multicrewed efforts naturally require that both team members are either in Open or the same Private Group. It is possible to join a ship as a SLF pilot from anywhere in the Milky Way, so this also provides an opportunity for some racing action for pilots away on distant expeditions, or who dislike driving a SRV in high gravity in the dark! Entries are accepted from all platforms on which Elite: Dangerous: Horizons is available and which are capable of providing the required screenshots or video as race evidence. \n. \n Submitting a Race Entry ​ The race begins on Saturday 29th September 3304 and ends at midnight on Monday October 8th 3304: entries must start between 00:00:00 September 29th 3304 and 23:59:59 October 8th 3304. \nPlease declare an intent to race in this thread, in order that other participants can look out for you on the course. It may also help you to attract a pilot for your SLF or find someone willing for you to fly their SLF. It is not required if you prefer not to, however. If you want to fly a SLF but not a mothership, feel free to request this in the thread! Race entries are submitted by sending a PM to me on the Frontier Forums with the following information: \n \n CMDR name \n SLF pilot CMDR name (Multicrewed attempts only) \n Race Mode ( Regulation Keelback ,  Single Unlimited ,  Multicrewed Regulation Keelback  or  Multicrewed Unlimited ) \n Ship name \n Ship and SLF type \n Race time \n Link to race evidence (video or screenshots, see below) \n Race Evidence: the following information must be provided by screenshots (taken with the F10 key in-game on PC, console versions have alternative bindings) or be visible on a video. Screenshots can no longer be hosted on the forum and must be uploaded elsewhere (e.g. Imgur or equivalent) and a link provided. Video entries should be uploaded to a suitable video-hosting service (e.g. YouTube or equivalent) and the link provided. \n \n Outfitting of the ship showing the Optional Internal modules, with the jump range and Fighter Hangar / SLF type visible. For the Regulation Keelback (Multicrewed or otherwise) the Core Internals must also be shown. (2 screenshots for Regulation Keelback modes, 1 otherwise) \n The SRV on the start line at Koolhaas' Folly (see above screenshot for positioning) showing the clock: this will be your start time. (1 screenshot) \n The SRV within 0.0020 degrees (both latitude and longitude) of latitude: 30.6568 degrees / longitude: 24.8607 degrees. (1 screenshot) \n The SLF passing through the ring of either of the Majestic class Interdictors berthed at the Capital Ship Dock at Larg AB 1 and docking with the mothership afterwards. (2 screenshots) \n The SLF passing through or inside a tunnel at the Military Installation orbiting Gridge 1 and docking with the mothership afterwards. (2 screenshots) \n The SLF passing through the tunnel through the perimeter wall of Koolhaas' Folly and docking with the mothership afterwards. (2 screenshots) \n The mothership on the pad at Koolhaas' Folly showing the in-game clock. This will be your finish time. (1 screenshot) \n This requires a total of 10 screenshots, or 11 for the Regulation Keelback modes, if video is not used. For Multicrewed entries, a mixture of video and screenshots is acceptable or both CMDRs can use video, or both can use screenshots. It does not matter whether the mothership or SLF pilot submits the entry so long as the information is provided; you can co-ordinate with your teammate who gathers and submits the race evidence. For examples of suitable screenshots when submitting race evidence, see also the Buckyball Racing Club's website. \n. \n Additional Notes ​ It is permitted to use synthesis to repair and refuel the SRV. \nYou can fly through the tunnels/rings in any direction. \nIt is not necessary to have an assigned fighter pilot for you to order your mothership to hold position whilst in the SLF. \nYou cannot deploy the SLF within the no-fire zone of a station or outpost, however this restriction does not apply for docking the SLF. \nPip settings for the SLF are not preserved between launches. \nIf you are shot down by the authorities with a bounty or a fine outstanding, then the detention centre you will  probably  respawn at is  The Sepulchre  in Col 285 Sector YU-F c11-1. This is 68.94 LY away from HIP 73293. \nThere is an Interstellar Factor at Dyson Orbital, Mandubii, should you need their services. \nThere is a Guardians Tech Broker at Smoot Orbital, Chona, where all current models of SLF are available. \nThere is a raw Materials Trader at Matthaus Olbers Station in HIP 73293, should you want extra materials for SRV repair/refuel without wanting to spend time farming them. \nHave fun! \n \n Leaderboards \n \n Regulation Keelback ​ \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n Single Unlimited ​ \n\n

they sure know how to party after a race.  Following one of the recent races though there's been an influx of miners in the Fullerene C60 system, brought by the recommendations of the racers who passed through their system, and as well as keeping Bucky busy they've been talking about the new Asteroid bases that have been constructed over the last year in the core systems.  They love being assigned to work at them as the water preserved in the asteroid itself makes the most amazing ice to put in their drinks, but the bars are run down, poorly managed and struggling to sustain the trade. \n \nBucky was never one for understanding why people insist on putting ice in their spirits, but these visitors had cleared him out of it, he needed some more and saw an opportunity to expand his empire into the asteroid market.  So he needs your help! \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \nTake 5 Buckyball Beer Mats and deliver one to each of the asteroid bases nearby, to offer them the help they need if they join Bucky's empire.  And on your way back make sure to pick up 5t of water from Jack's Town, which has the purest water of them all, and deliver it back to Bucky so he can keep his punters happy. \n \n \n The Course \n \nStart at Rebuy Prospect in the Fullerene C60 system and then call at each of the following asteroid stations in any order: \n \nLone Rock - Othime \nFreeholm - Artemis \nJack's Town - Felkan \nSimbad's Refuge - Nu Tauri \nBig Pappa's Base - Andhrimi \n \nThen land back at Rebuy Prospect \n \nThere is no requirement in Open Unlimited as to when you buy the Water from Jack's Town, but in the Regulation Dolphin it will need to be your last stop. \n \n Entry Classes \n \nEntries will be accepted in two classes: Open Unlimited and Regulation Dolphin \n \nFor Open Unlimited class, you may use any ship type, and engineer-modified modules are allowed.  Guardian FSD Boosters are  not  allowed.  Neutron/White Dwarf boosts are allowed, however FSD Synthesis boost is not. \n \nFor the Regulation Dolphin class you need to use  this specific build.   If Bucky's really going to grab the attention of these bar owners, then you need to deliver the Beer Mats in style!  At time of writing the closest source with all of the required items is Scully-Power Station in Ix 94.71Ly away. \n \n \n The Equaliser \n \nIn order to try and encourage variety in ship types for the Open Unlimited class, I have implemented a timing system based on the jump range of your chosen ship.  I am using 35Ly as the base jump range, if you are over that then you incur a time penalty at the end of your race, if you are under that then you get a bonus.  This will allow you to use your favourite/fastest ship, even if the jump range might normally exclude it.  The penalty/bonus is 45 seconds per jump (calculated by using EDDiscovery), it will be based on your current jump range in the Outfitting Screen when unladen, with full fuel tank (I will require a screenshot of the Optional Internals screen in Outfitting to show that you have a cargo rack big enough) and you will be graded on the closet higher value.  For example if your jump range is 35.01Ly you will take the penalty for having a 40Ly jump range, just as you would if you had a 40.00Ly range.  5t of cargo should only reduce your jump distance by roughly 1Ly. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n How To Enter \n \nState your intent to race in the thread below. \n \nRace entries must start any time after 00:00:00 game time on Monday 20th August, and finish any time before 23:59:59 game time on Monday 27th August (as long as your run is started before 23:59:59 Monday 27th it will be accepted). \n \n Standard information on how to enter, including example screenshots, can be found on the Buckyball Racing Club website. \n \nEntries can be in any play mode, but joining the regulars in open play is encouraged.  \n \nEntries must include: \n \n For Open Unlimited a screenshot of your ship outfitting showing Optional internals and your jump range and cargo capacity. \n For Regulation Dolphin 2 screenshots of your ship outfitting showing Core and Optional internals and your jump range and cargo capacity. \n The normal starting screenshot, showing your ship on the pad at Rebuy Prospect, with the station clock visible -

This drifting theory proved correct, entering the ice pack north of  Siberia , and 3 year later was released close to the  Svalbard archipelago . But the drift trajectory only reached 85°57'N keeping the ship away from The North pole. Nansen made a bid to reach the Pole with 3 dog sleds, leaving Fram under command of Otto Sverdrup, but was not able to make the pole due to the extreme conditions, and wisely opted to go back to the civilization. Nansen reached 86°13.6′N, 314km closer to the North Pole than previous explorers. Nansen's party and Fram returned separately but nearly at the same time to get a triumphant reception. \n \nFram's second expedition was under command of  Otto Sverdrup , to survey the west coast of Greenland. After some modifications based on the experience of the first expedition, Fram salied to West Greenland but was blocked in  Nares Strait, a pass to the west of the island, where they met  Robert Peary 's Greenland Expedition. To avoid an exploration competition Sverdrup spent the next 4 years charting the coast of Ellesmere Island and the islands to the west, and archipelago currently known as Sverdrup Islands. The results of the expedition were impressive in many scientific fields, collecting valuable information. \n \n The third and most important expedition of the Fram  was under command of  Roald Amundsen . Initially proposed to be a second attempt of Nanasen's idea to drift to the North Pole, Amundsen secretly changed the objective to reach the South Pole when reports that two separate explorers,  Peary  and  Cook , had already reached the North Pole. Fram sailed to Kristiansand to pick up the dogs for the expedition, but then turned South, to Antartica. Amundsen sent telegrams explaining his new plans to his headquarters and to his colleague  Robert Falcon Scott  who was intending to reach the South pole at the same time; this action was in general not  welcome, specially in Scott's homeland. After sailing 15000km to the south, Fram reached 78°41'S, latitude in the Bay of Whales, said to be farther south than any other wooden ship ever reached. Amundsen landed building materials, equipment and supplies, and prepared his assault on the South pole; in the meantime Fram was sent to make oceanographic studies in the Southern Ocean under Captain Thorvald Nilsen. \nAmundsen and his 4 companions reached the South Pole on 14 December 1911 in good shape after 8 hard weeks, helped by the careful planing, the skills that he and his crew had achieved in previous expeditions and the good weather. Scott arrived at the Pole on 17 January 1912, just to find a tent with Amundsen's country Flag (Norway) and a Fram's pennant. Scott and his companions perished on the way back when they got trapped by a fierce blizzard, only few kilometres from a supply depot. \n \nAmundsen and his crew were received as Heroes. It took some time for Fram, but on 16 July 1914 the ship returned to her home port. \n \nThe Fram is, now housed and exhibited in the  Fram Museum  at Bygdøynes, Oslo. \n \nFram in her environment: Drifting in the Arctic \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wind generator deployed \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \nAmundsen and his party at the South Pole\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Original photograph , found in National Library of Australia in 2009.

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nStarports can be found in a wide variety of locations, some of them close enough to their parent body that the supercruise approach becomes much more of an art than a science. Many will have heard of Robert Aitken Orbital in Firdaus, where the station famously skims remarkably close above the clouds of a gas giant. Not far away is Votatini, where last year Cmdr TheMadOll, with assistance from Cmdrs Rinzler Black, Frank and Edward Robinson,  managed to pilot an SRV from King Terminal on the planet's surface all the way into the dock of the orbital starport Valigursky Orbital . \n \nClose Encounters is a race around some of the area's lower orbits, including Firdaus and Votatini along with a starport orbiting inside the rings of an earthlike world, and an asteroid base within the rings of a gas giant. \n \n >   >   >  SUBMIT ENTRY HERE  <   <   < ​ \n The Course \n \nStart and finish docked at  Kuchner Vision  in  Kured \nIn between, call at the following stations: \n \n Robert Aitken Orbital  in  Firdaus \n Iben Hub  in  Iota Hydri \n Big Pappa's Base  in  Andhrimi \n Valigursky Orbital  in  Votatini  * \n \nNote: The recommended and expected route is to follow the order listed above, or the same in reverse. However, as the low orbits mean that this race has a much greater than normal chance of obscured jumps, I will accept entries calling at the waypoint stations in any order. \n \n * Don't worry, I'm only asking you to dock your ship here, not your SRV! \n \n Entry Classes \n \nEntries will be accepted in two classes: Open Unlimited and Scout. \n \nFor Open Unlimited class, you may use any ship type, and engineer-modified modules are allowed (as are experimental / Guardian technologies). \n \nFor Scout class, Lakon Spaceways invites commanders to try out one of the least common amongst the current stable of ships, the Diamondback Scout (yes, that reads Scout, not Explorer).

The name  \" base jump \"  came from the acronym B(uilding) A(ntenna) S(pan) E(arth), things the base jumper would climb and then, you guessed it, jump off. Typically using parachutes or wing-suits to survive the fall, the objective was to have a  \" wild ride man! \"  and survive to make a cool video about it that could be shared on social media. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nFast forward nearly 1500 years and we find ourselves parked on top of the 15km high mountain next to Smith Base in the Beta Sculptoris system thinking, well basically ...  \" let's do this thing! \" \n \nSo, on with the race instructions (please arm yourself with a strong coffee and a large pad of paper before opening this spoiler 'cos you're going to need to concentrate now and make copious notes). \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nBazinga! \n \nBut seriously, the actual rules (in case the above diagram isn't 100% clear): \n \n1) Fly to the Beta Sculptoris system, head on down to Smith Base (planet ABC 4 A B) and land right on the top of the nearby mountain (landing co-ordinates should be within latitude -5.06 to -5.10 and longitude +97.95 to +97.99). \n \n2) Deploy your SRV and take a screenshot which shows the appropriate co-ordinates, the HUD clock and an indicated speed of zero. \n \n3) Drive to any garage at Smith Base (more on this in a minute) and take a second screenshot which clearly shows you parked inside the garage with the HUD clock visible (no need to request boarding permission, no need to board your ship). \n \n4) Winner is the person with the fastest time between those two screenshots. ​ \nMore on  \" driving to Smith Base \" . \n \nOK, so clearly the word  \" drive \"  doesn't quite do justice to the insane,  400km/hr freefall down a 15km high jagged mountainside which you are about to experience. Courage my dear commander, courage! Here are a few tips: \n \n1) You are allowed to repair the SRV as many times as you like on the way down so don't forget to highlight SRV repair synthesis in the right-hand inventory panel BEFORE you set off. \n \n2) The local gravity will tend to pull you down the slope and off to the left of Smith Base so aim to the right of it at the beginning to counter this. \n \n3) Be wary of picking up too much speed, especially towards the bottom half of the mountain as it's  extremely  easy to overshoot the base by a good 20km or more (I guarantee at least one of you will do this). ​ \nAdditional challenges. \n \nAs well as the main competition for outright fastest time there are a few additional challenges which you might like to have a go at: \n \n1)  \" Falling Fast \"  - winner is the person with the highest displayed speed during the descent (remember, indicated speed is for the direction you're facing in). Include extra screenshot showing speed and the HUD clock to take part in this challenge. \n \n2)  \" Falling Upwards \"  - winner is the person with the highest altitude displayed in their SRV HUD during the descent. Include extra screenshot showing the altitude and the clock to take part in this challenge. \n \n3)  \" Falling With Style \"  - winner is the person who manages to string together the best series of stunts and tricks during their descent. This will require video evidence of the stunt sequence. Videos will be judged on criteria such as number of spins, loops, rolls, etc, audaciousness of stunt considering speed and terrain, how clear it is that the stunt was intentional and embellishments such as lasers, light flashing and local chat exclamations during the stunt. ​ \nNote: screenshots/videos for additional challenges must all occur between the start and end points of a qualifying run (i.e. it's all very well making some totally insane stunt video but if you don't survive and make it to Smith base to tell the tale then I'm afraid your footage will be considered  \" lost \"  and your tales of pulling 5km high  \" switch backside bloody draculas \"  all the way down will be treated as nothing more than idle bragging [B]*[/B] ). \n \n *  actually - although your video won't qualify for the official  \" Falling With Style \"  challenge scoreboard, do please share it anyway! \n\t\t \n\t \n The race starts at 00:00 (game time) on Saturday 19th May 3304 and is currently scheduled to run until 23:59 (game time) on Sunday 27th May 3304. All submitted screenshots and/or videos must be taken between these two times. \n \nRace submissions should include at least two screenshots (more for additional challenges as described above) which should be uploaded as an album to an image sharing website such as  IMGUR . You should then send me the URL of that album along with the following additional details: \n \n- Your commander name. \n- Your forum name if different. \n- The name of your SRV. \n- The time you are claiming for your run. \n- The height/speed you are claiming for any additional challenges and, if you're entering the  \" Falling With Style \"  challenge, the URL of your stunt video. ​ \n I may decide to create a Google Form for submitting your entries but if not then  just pm me here on the forum with a subject line of  \" Falling with style -  < your commander name here > \" . (n.b. anyone who actually puts  \" < your commander name here > \"  in the subject line will be docked 10 seconds and made to stand in the corner for 5 minutes). \n \n IMPORTANT UPDATE TO RULES \nRuns should be submitted within 48hrs of completion! In other words, if you complete a run at 22:00 on Monday 21st May then you should submit the entry for that run no later than 22:00 on Wednesday 23rd May. The reason for this is to prevent people from simply sitting on their best runs all week without engaging with the forum thread and the other participants. Part of the ethos of the Buckyball Racing Club is one of active involvement with the group and friendly sharing of times, tales and tips. It's fun for everyone to see the new times being submitted throughout the duration of the event and to see the best racers competing for those coveted top spots on the leaderboard. I do realise that the SRV HUD doesn't show the date. I could change the rules to say that you have to dock in the garage at the end and have the station clock visible in the screenshot but I don't really want to so take this as an informal request to play fair OK? If anyone who hasn't posted all week submits a winning run on Sunday night then chins will be stroked! \n \nSome general rules on how to enter a Buckyball Race (some of which will probably apply) can be found  here . \n \nAnd there are a couple of videos of test runs which you might find instructive and/or terrifying here. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Speed run. \n \n[video=youtube_share;zHBBQYr1z90]https://youtu.be/zHBBQYr1z90[/video] \n \nStyle run. \n \n[video=youtube_share;5Z2DAYAMFK4]https://youtu.be/5Z2DAYAMFK4[/video] \n\t\t \n\t \n OK, that's it folks! Feel free to get some practice in, try not to die, try not to overshoot and above all else, try to have a wild ride man! \n \nP.S. join us in Discord for live chat before, during or after the race! \n \n \n \n \nFAQ \n \nQ) Does our screenshot for altitude or speed have to come from our fastest run? Or can we do, say, one run going for altitude, another for speed, and one for time (and style)? \nA)  I'm happy to have separate submissions for time, speed, altitude and style if that's how it pans out ... as long as the altitude, speed and style ones are each part of a successful run (i.e. with accompanying start and finish screenshots to prove that you set off from the right place and survived your amazing display of altitude and/or speed and/or style). \n \nQ) Is it posssible to ride an SRV on a ship? \nA) Riding your SRV on another commanders ship will NOT be allowed, riding it on your own ship however ... well I wouldn't  dismiss  the idea  \n \nQ) How did you manage to find such a fantastic location? \nA) I didn't - the location was pointed out to me by  \" lightspeed \"  over in the  guide-to-good-base-jumping-locations  thread so if you like the place then go and bung him some rep! \n \nQ) Is it ever daytime there? (aka  \" I can't see a bloody thing \" ) \nA) Cmdr Bruski has asked me to point out that turning up your gamma/brightness in display settings can make a HUGE difference. \n \n \nAnd now a word from

one bar to the next with a group of friends, having a merry time and finishing up with a plate of spicy food or dancing the night away in a club - or perhaps unconscious in a pool of their own vomit while their mates upload photos on GalNet! \n \nSadly in the early thirty-fourth century the very best drinks are closely guarded secrets, only available outside their own systems for prices of up to 17,000 credits per glass! \n \nSo for a really good pub crawl, the only option for non-billionaires in to visit bars in different systems, and one really good pub crawl is the  \" Glorious Golden Kylie \"  visiting the bars of the home systems of seven of the galaxy's finest beverages, as well as four more rough-and-ready space-bars and finishing up in the famous curry house The Galaxy's End in Roddenberry Gateway / Ochoeng, where they serve many traditional ales as well as the  Total Annihilation Vindaloo , laced with so many Ochoeng chillies that it is almost certainly the hottest curry in the galaxy. \n \nA little too hot for you? Then maybe try a  Smiling Dog Jalfrezi  - not as hot as the Total Annihilation, but still spicy enough to bring salty tears to any commander's eyes. \n \nThe only trouble is that the Glorious Golden Kylie is obviously around a thousand light years long, so unfortunately that means either paying for a space-taxi (preferably a fast one!) or picking a designated pilot! \n \nFor this event your task is to act as the designated pilot for your mates (boo!), set off from Rebuy Prospect with a bunch of friends and a load of Buckyball Beer Mats (to hand out to Buckyball fans en-route), fly into the bubble and get your mates in and out of every bar along the Glorious Golden Kylie as quickly as possible - once you get to The Galaxy's End in Ochoeng you can sit back and enjoy a pint and a curry (not to mention a few extra drinks you've picked up along the route). \n  \n Buckyball Fans! \nThis will be the first BRC event to be run since FD's secret 3.0.5.1 update, which added Buckyball fans to the game. \nWhile flying between waypoints in the race you'll be able to recognise Buckyball fans from their catchphrase  \" I've come a long way for what's in your hold. \"  There's nothing a Buckyball fan likes more than being given a few Buckyball Beer Mats, but you need at least eight tons to complete the race, so you might like to carry a few extra with you to dish out to fans along the route. Otherwise you probably want to avoid these groupies if at all possible, they tend to get angry if they can't have their souvenir beer mats. \n \nThe unauthorised installation in Rahu is a particular favourite meet up spot for Buckyball fans - that's why we're giving the place a fly through - there's so many Buckyball fans around here that they won't be happy unless they get ALL your Beer mats! So best get in and out of there as quickly as possible. \n \n [size=+2] PROVISIONAL FINAL STANDINGS [/size] \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n \n [size=+2]RACE RULES AND REGULATIONS[/size] \nRules: \n \n Start at  Rebuy Prospect  in  Fullerene C60  with at least eight tons of Buckyball Beer Mats in your hold. \n Visit in any order the eleven destinations listed as The Glorious Golden Kylie below. \n At each of the seven rare stations sell one ton of Buckyball Beer Mats and buy one ton of the listed rare commodity. \n If the faction state at the station means that the rare drink isn't available ( \" Oh no! The bar's closed! \" ), then keep the beer mats and trade two tons of mats for two tons of booze at the next station. \n At each of the three space-bar installations take screenshot in front of one of the Lavian Brandy billboards - optionally drop off one ton of Beer Mats for the local Buckyball fans. \n At the unregistered outpost installation take screenshots as you blast through  TWO separate  tunnels - optionally drop off one ton of Beer Mats for the local Buckyball fans. \n Finish the race at  Roddenberry Gateway  in  Ochoeng , with at least eight tons of rares in the hold, including one ton of Beer Mats. \n \n After the race: \n \n Enjoy the curry. \n Optionally, on the way back to the start line visit Nowak Orbital in Kachirigin for some Kachirigin Filter Leeches, the best hangover cure in the galaxy.  \n \n [size=+2]The Glorious Golden Kylie[/size] \n Stations: \n \n Hart Station in Bast - RARE: Bast Snake Gin \n Mansfield Orbiter in Epsilon Indi - RARE: Indi Bourbon \n Azeban City in Eranin - RARE: Erarin Pearl Whisky \n Laplace Ring in Kongga - RARE: Kongga Ale \n Lave Station in Lave - RARE: Lavian Brandy \n George Lucas in Leesti - RARE: Leestian Evil Juice \n Kingsbury Dock in Thrutis - RARE: Thrutis Cream \n Civilian Installations: \n \n 11 Parsecs near HIP 110028 6 \n Civilian Installation near Thrutis A 2 \n DaMorgs Bar and BBQ near Wangal A 5 \n Unauthorised Installation: \n \n Unauthorised Installation near Rahu 1 \n \n \n \n [size=+2] Optional Bonuses: [/size] \n \n \n Another Round? \nReceive up to  three minutes  of bonus time for taking a screenshot parked by a second Lavian Brandy billboard (1 minute per screenshot, one bonus per space-bar) at any of the three space-bar installations. \n \n Down the Hatch! \nReceive up to  two minutes  of bonus time for fly-throughs of additional tunnels at the unregistered outpost in Rahu (one minute per tunnel, up to two extra tunnels - so four tunnels in total). I'd prefer video evidence of this if possible, to show that different tunnels were used. \n These tunnels do not all need to different, but you cannot use the same tunnel twice in a row. \n \n It's A Giveaway! \nReceive up to  ten minutes  of bonus time for delivering extra beer mats to Buckyball fans at the installations. One minute bonus per screenshot if the  \" cargo canister jettisoned \"  message is displayed in your installation evidence screenshot (or your video shows you jettisoned at the correct point). \nSo you can jettison one canister while stationary in front of a Lavian Brandy billboard at a space-bar installation and one per tunnel while flying though the unauthorised outpost in Rahu (no need to be stationary). Don't forget to save enough beer mats to finish the race! \nThis bonus stacks with the extra billboard / tunnel selfies above. \n \n Meet and Greet. \nReceive a  two minute  bonus if you successfully satisfy a Buckyball fan who interdicts you along the route (or scans you at an installation). \nYour screenshot must include the ship's clock and text in the comms window indicating that the Buckyball fan was satisfied by the beer mats that you drop. Once the fan is satisfied you must send the following message to local comms,  \" Always nice to meet up with Buckyball fans! \"  This text must appear in the comms window of the evidence screenshot. \nNote: While encountering Buckyball fans during testing, 2-4 tons of Beer mats would probably have satisfied them. Again, don't forget to save enough beer mats to finish the race! \n \n The More the Merrier! \nReceive a  five minute  bonus if you fit four addition economy seats (either one extra class 3E cabin or two class 2E modules). \n \n [size=+2] Purely Optional Experimental Gameplay: [/size] \nI'd originally planned for this race to have compulsory passengers on board (via missions), but the difficulty with RNG, required reputation, potential loss of reputation and the small number of passenger seats in a 3E cabin, meant that I left in the cabin requirement, but dropped the need to actually carry passengers. \n \nHowever for the upcoming Bootlegger Challenge II / Black Riband ongoing event (where all runs are one-offs), I will be including a leaderboard for passenger carrying runs (Little Nuk's Booze Cruise). So if some of you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you could grab some passengers and test out my BRC passenger gameplay: \n \nFind a single passenger mission of any type that can fit into your ship's economy seating. Prior to launch take a screenshot of your transactions tab showing that you have a single passenger mission. Then open the mission to display pre-launch passenger satisfaction. \nAfter finishing in Ochoeng, take a final screenshot showing passenger satisfaction. \nYour passenger satisfaction will be listed on the main leaderboard if this is your fastest run. Additionally you'll receive a score on a separate leaderboard, scored as follows: \n \n Base Score: 5000 points. \n Every full second less than 90 minutes +1 point \n Every full second more than 90 minutes -1 point \n Passenger Satisfaction: Happy   +300 points \n Passenger Satisfaction: Content -60  points \n Passenger Satisfaction: Unhappy -300 points \n Passenger Satisfaction: Mission Failed or Empty Cabin -500 points \n \n \n \n [size=+2]Race Classes:[/size] \nDesignated Pilot Class (unlimited): \n \n Fly a ship of any class (but see compulsory modules below \n Note that ships larger than a Python probably won't fit through the tunnels in Rahu. \n Engineering is permitted. \n FSD Supercharging from non-main sequence stars is permitted. \n FSD Supercharging from jumponium synthesis is  not  permitted. \n Your ship  must  be fitted with a class 3E (economy) passenger cabin. \n Your ship  must be  fitted with at least 8 tons of cargo racks. \n \n Cabbie Class (regulation): \n \n Fly either a hauler taxi or adder taxi \n Link to hauler taxi:  http://www.edshipyard.com/#/L=B0V0,,,9p30A4O0AJY0AZA0Ani0B1K0BGy0BWQ0,,05U01ZE04xo002M0 \n Link to adder taxi:  http://www.edshipyard.com/#/L=B0f0,,,9p30A5y0ALQ0Aak0Ani0B2k0BK40BX_0,,05U04zq01Xg01Xg002M0 \n Engineering is  not  permitted. \n FSD Supercharging from non-main sequence stars is permitted. \n FSD Supercharging from jumponium synthesis is  not  permitted. \n BEWARE: This is rather a long race, and these ships only have a 21LY range with 8t of cargo aboard. \nCompleting the course in Cabbie Class is likely to take  2-3 hours .  \nA 'Regulation Dolphin' class might have been better, but I wanted to stick with cheap regulation ships and I think the Dolphin is Horizons only! \n \n \n \n [size=+2] TRAVEL DISTANCES [/size] \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n \n [size=+2] HOW TO ENTER [/size] \nSee  How to enter  on the Buckyball Racing Club homepage for general details on entering the race. \n \nAn online submission form will be set up before Friday night. \n \nOnly entries made wholly within the period  3304-04-28 00:00:01  to  3304-05-06 23:59:59  server time will be accepted. \n EDIT: The race is now extended by one week to  3304-05-13 23:59:59  server time. \n \nEntries can be in any play mode, but joining the regulars in open play is encouraged.  \n \nEntries must include: \n \n Your CMDR name. \n Your forum name if not the same as your CMDR name. \n Your ship type. \n Your ship name. \n For  Cabbie Class :  A screenshot of your ship outfitting showing your jump range and cargo capacity.   \n Prior to launch, a screenshot of the commodities market at Rebuy Prospect showing at least 8 tons of Buckyball Beer Mats in your hold. \n The normal starting screenshot, showing your ship on the pad at Rebuy Prospect, with the station clock visible -  THIS IS YOUR START TIME. \n Landing screenshots on the pad at each of the 7 rares selling stations en-route, each showing the station clock \n Commodities screenshots at each of the above stations, showing the amount of beer mats you had when you docked (ie before selling 1t to that station) \n **If no rare booze is available, a screenshot of station services, showing the minor faction state. \n Screenshots in at least two tunnels of the unregistered outpost in Rahu. \n Screenshots taken directly in front of at least one Lavian Brandy (or other rare booze) advertising billboard at each on the three space-bar civilian outposts \n A landed screenshot on the pad at Roddenberry Gateway / Ochoeng, showing the station clock -  THIS IS YOUR FINISHING TIME \n Post race screenshots from the Roddenberry Gateway commodities market showing: \n At least one ton of Buckyball Beer Mats remaining (to give to race fans at The Galaxy's End). \n Seven tons of rare booze (unless faction states made this impossible) \n At least 8 tons of the above cargoes in total. \n \n \n At no time during the race should you ever be carrying less than 8 tons of rare cargo (except when buying/selling in the commodities market). \nLosing rare booze, or selling / dropping too many beer mats and ending up with less than 8 tons in total means that run has failed. \n \n \n \n[SIZE=+2] Screenshots [/SIZE] \nScreenshots may be taken using the in-game screenshot function (F10 key) or your choice of third-party software.

There's 3 installations where we can park next to 2 brandy billboards, dropping a beermat at each for a total of 6. Then there's Rahu where we can fly through up to 4 tunnels, again dropping a beermat in each. That's the 10 right? \n That's correct. \n Does it have to be brandy adverts, I seem to recall seeing other alchohol related billboards? \n I only noticed Lavian Brandy ads, but there are others then yes - any one/two alcohol related billboards will do. \n Do we have to drink for real? \n Nope, just flying is fine. \n Can we drink for real? \n It would be totally irresponsible of the Buckyball Racing Club to encourage binge drinking... \n...but if you like to binge drink anyway, it could be amusing - please post video to Galnet / Youtube - Just make sure you don't throw up on your HOTAS! \n Is there going to be a live race? \n I'll see what I can do - unfortunately real-life stuff means that it'll have to be in the final weekend. \n \n \n \n [SIZE=+2]RUN SUBMISSION FORM[/SIZE]

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t One of ancient Earth's more intriguing customs took place on April 1st of each year when people would play pranks on their friends, typically by trying to trick them into believing outlandish claims.  The gullible victim would be labelled an April Fool and the day was often referred to as April Fools' Day.  In the country of France it was also popular for children to attempt to affix a paper cutout of a fish on to an adult's back without being noticed.  Such a fish was known as the  poisson d'avril , which can be literally translated as the April Fish. \n \nThis April the Buckyball Racing Club celebrates the whimsical old tradition with a race between  Poisson Orbital  in the Kappa system and  Poisson Enterprise  in Trevakat.  Racers must visit four fish-themed stations along the way, and can earn bonus time by carrying out various optional challenges. \n \n [size=+2] CLASSIFICATION [/size] \n \n R S E CMDR name Forum name Ship name Ship type Route Challenges Raced Bonus Total 1 1 Bruski Bruski Ecco Dolphin [size=-2]Kappa,  Okinura ,  Rod , Liu Baja, Oitbi, Gorynich, Kathaima, Trevakat[/size] [size=-2]So long, Thanks for all the fish (5m26s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour, Poisson d'avril[/size] 00:36:45 00:20:26 00:16:19 2 2 MostlyEvilKiwi MostlyEvilKiwi Regulation Dolphin [size=-2]Kappa, LTT 4461,  Okinura ,  Rod , Wailladyan, Liu Baja, Kathaima, Trevakat[/size] [size=-2]So long, Regulation Dolphin, Fish in a barrel (1m29s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour[/size] 00:35:43 00:18:49 00:16:54 3 3 t Azzie Elbub Ashnak Lollipop Dolphin [size=-2]Trevakat,  Pole , Ross 130,  Okinura ,  Rod , Jambaraya, Gliese 4261, Shany, Kappa[/size] [size=-2]So long, Fish in a barrel (1m15s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour[/size] 00:34:41 00:17:15 00:17:26 4 4 t Alec Turner Alec Turner Champagne Charlie Dolphin [size=-2]Kappa,  Okinura ,  Rod , Ross 130,  Pole , Shany, Oitbi, Jambaraya, Trevakat[/size] [size=-2]So long, Fish in a barrel (1m35s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour[/size] 00:35:52 00:17:35 00:18:17 5 1 t Inodoro Pereyra Onane Tuna Can II Asp Explorer [size=-2]Trevakata,  Pole , Ross 130,  Okinura ,  Rod , Jambaraya, Gliese 4261, Shany, Kappa[/size] [size=-2]Fish in a barrel (1m30s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour, Poisson d'avril[/size] 00:33:03 00:13:30 00:19:33 6 1 t Milner Milner Maiden Voyage Diamondback Explorer [size=-2]Trevakat,  Pole , Shany, Ross 130,  Okinura ,  Rod , Jambaraya, Oitbi, Kappa[/size] [size=-2]Fish in a barrel (1m31s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour[/size] 00:32:18 00:11:31 00:20:47 7 2 t Raiko Raiko The Nomad Asp Explorer [size=-2]Kappa,  Okinura , Ross 130,  Rod , Jambaraya, Gliese 4261, Manidone, Trevakat[/size] [size=-2]Fish in a barrel *18s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour[/size] 00:28:53 00:07:18 00:21:35 8 5 Edelgard von Rhein Edelgard von Rhein Whisper of Freedom Dolphin [size=-2]Kappa, Liu Baja, Oitbi, Gorynich, Kathaima, Trevakat[/size] [size=-2]So long, Regulation Dolphin, Fish in a barrel (1m40s)[/size] 00:36:28 00:12:00 00:24:28 9 6 Stern Winter Stern Winter Frozen Flipper Filet Dolphin [size=-2]Kappa, HIP 46007, LTT 4461, Ross 130, Kathaima[/size] [size=-2]So long, Regulation Dolphin, Fish in a barrel (1m40s)[/size] 00:44:40 00:12:00 00:32:40 10 7 Gunthar Gunthar CeN'est Pas Une Poissn Dolphin [size=-2]Kappa, HIP 46007, LTT 4461, Ross 130,  Okinura ,  Rod , Kathaima, Trevakat[/size] [size=-2]So long, Thanks for all the fish (5m47s), Regulation Dolphin, Fish in a barrel (1m5s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour, Poisson d'avril[/size] 01:16:58 00:25:12 00:51:46 11 8 t Crotalus crotalus Delphinus Dolphin [size=-2]Trevakat,  Hamlet's Harmony ,  Pole ,  Okinura ,  Rod , Manidone, Gliese 4261, Jambaraya, Ross 130, Kappa[/size] [size=-2]So long, Thanks for all the fish (1m51s), Fish in a barrel (1m8s), Fly fishing, Turbot hour, Hypoplectrus space, Poisson d'avril[/size] 13:15:41 00:51:59 12:23:42 \n \n [size=+2] RACE RULES AND REGULATIONS [/size] \n [size=+1] Rules [/size] \n \n Start at either  Poisson Orbital  in  Kappa  or  Poisson Enterprise  in  Trevakat . \n Visit - in any order -   at least  four  of sixteen  waypoint  stations named after the  bass ,  pike ,  ray  and  sturgeon  fish. \n Optionally complete one or more of the challenges listed below to earn a time bonus. \n Finish the race by docking at either  Poisson Enterprise  or  Poisson Orbital .  You must not start and finish at the same station! \n Optionally fly the course in reverse! \n \n [size=+1] Regulations [/size] \nThe race runs from  Saturday March 31st 3304 at 00:00:00  to  Sunday April 8th at 23:59:59 .  Entries made wholly or in part outside this period will be rejected.  All times are  server time . \n \nOnly entries made in  Open  mode will be eligible for classification.  Entries from Solo or Private Group mode will be added to the leaderboard as exhibition runs with their entry endorsed with an  x  notation.  They will not receive an official position. \n \nThe race can be flown from the  start line  at  Poisson Orbital  in  Kappa  to the  finish line  at  Poisson Enterprise  in  Trevakat .  Alternatively it can be flown in reverse, with the start line being at  Poisson Enterprise  and the finish line being at  Poisson Orbital . \n \nTo complete an entry, a competitor must dock at  at least  four of the  waypoint  stations listed below, in any order. \n \n Bass Dock  in  HIP 46007 \n Bass Landing  in  Gliese 4261 \n Bass Port  in  Wailladyan \n Bass Terminal  in  Oitbi \n Pike Landing  in  Kathaima \n Pike Landing  in  Shany \n Pike Terminal  in  HR 5716 \n Pike Terminal  in  Manidone \n Ray Dock  in  Liu Baja \n Ray Port  in  Ross 130 \n Ray Terminal  in  Kamchadal \n Ray Terminal  in  Uteran \n Sturgeon Dock  in  Jambaraya \n Sturgeon Landing  in  Avaticus \n Sturgeon Port  in  Gorynich \n Sturgeon Terminal  in  LTT 4461 \n A valid entry will include a visit to at least one of each station named  Bass ,  Pike ,  Ray  and  Sturgeon  as well as at least one of each station named  Dock ,  Landing ,  Port  and  Terminal . \n \nEach waypoint station counts towards both sets of name requirements.  For example,  Bass Dock  is both a  Bass _  station and a  _ Dock  station. \n \nIt is permissible to visit more than four stations in order to check off all of the eight name requirements. \n \nThe following table summarises the available stations according to the two sets of names you must visit. \n \n \n Dock Landing Port Terminal Bass HIP 46007 Gliese 4261 Wailladyan Oitbi Pike - Kathaima \nShany - HR 5716 \nManidone Ray Liu Baja - Ross 130 Kamchadal \nUteran Sturgeon Jambaraya Avaticus Gorynich LTT 4461 \n \nFor example, a valid selection would be Bass Dock in HIP 46007, Ray Terminal in Kamchadal, Sturgeon Port in Gorynich and Pike Landing in Kathaima. \n \nRacers can submit as many entries as they like within the race period.  They are free to choose a different start and finish line for each entry, and to vary the choice of visited stations and attempted challenges. \n \n [size=+1] Challenges [/size] \nEarn a time bonus by completing one or more challenges during a race entry.  The benefits are cumulative so if you complete multiple challenges you can save more time.  The time it takes you to race to the finish line will be reduced by the sum of all challenge bonuses to yield your final leaderboard time. \n \n So long \nEarn a  6 minute  bonus by competing in a Dolphin, Orca or Beluga.  The bonus increases to  10 minutes 20 seconds  if you fly this  Regulation Dolphin  build. \n \n Thanks for all the fish \nEarn bonus time by carrying  fish  in your cargo hold.  The bonus available is calculated on a per-ship basis according to a  scrupulously fair  formula which takes into account each ship's maximum potential laden and unladen jump ranges as well as their maximum cargo capacity.  The more fish you  trawl  haul, the more time you will earn. \n \nYou must leave the start station with an  empty  hold.  You must visit each of the waypoint stations with  at least one  unit of fish in your hold and you must arrive at the finish station with  at least one  unit. \n \nYour bonus will be assessed based on the lowest amount of fish you had at any waypoint, rounded down to the nearest second.  Refer to the table below for the amount of bonus time awarded for each ton of fish you deliver. \n \nFor example, suppose you carried 24T of fish in a Cobra Mk III.  The bonus factor for the Cobra Mk III is  6.5920  so you would earn  158  seconds for delivering the cargo. \n \nYou will forfeit all bonus time from this challenge if you arrive at any  waypoint  station or the finish station with no fish in your hold.  Cargo other than fish does not count. \n \nExpand to see the list of bonus time (in seconds) per ton of cargo for each ship type. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n Ship Bonus   Ship Bonus Adder 18.0145 Hauler 27.6165 Alliance Chieftain 3.2859 Imperial Courier 17.3518 Anaconda 0.8501 Imperial Clipper 2.6151 Asp Explorer 1.8781 Imperial Cutter 1.0570 Asp Scout 4.8286 Imperial Eagle 28.8563 Beluga 1.1025 Keelback 5.3614 Cobra Mk III 6.5920 Orca 1.8571 Cobra Mk IV 6.9667 Panther Clipper 3.1415 Diamondback Explorer 2.4153 Python 2.3916 Diamondback Scout 9.4995 Sidewinder 48.4330 Dolphin 4.1864 Type-6 Transporter 4.3626 Eagle 28.8563 Type-7 Transported 2.2258 Federal Assault Ship 5.1354 Type-9 Heavy 2.1316 Federal Corvette 2.2567 Type-10 Defender 1.1913 Federal Dropship 5.2907 Viper 26.4738 Federal Gunship 5.4407 Viper Mk IV 7.8414 Fer-de-Lance 10.3434 Vulture 9.8564 \n[td][/td] \n\n[/td] \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Fish in a barrel \nEarn a bonus for flying without shields, armour or hull reinforcement packages, and without engineering your lightweight alloys, hand completing the whole course without repairing your ship.

For  Fish in a barrel  you should also show that you do not have shields, armour or reinforcement packages and you have not engineered your lightweight alloys. \n For  Fish in a barrel :  Screenshots of your credit balance at the start and end of the race, demonstrating that you did not spend money on repairs.  If you don't have a fuel scoop, for instance because you are attempting  Regulation Dolphin , you can include screenshots of station services after refueling, showing that the Repair All button remains unclicked. If you are also attempting  Thanks for all the fish , a screenshot of your transaction at the commodities market will validate that a reduction in credit balance was due to buying fish, not repairs. \n A screenshot of your ship on the pad at either  Poisson Orbital  or  Poisson Enterprise  showing the station clock.  The time shown will be your start time for the entry. \n For  Thanks for all the fish :  A screenshot of your empty cargo hold on the pad at the start line. \n A screenshot of your ship on the pad at each waypoint station. \n For  Thanks for all the fish :  A screenshot of your cargo hold on the pad at each waypoint. \n For  Fly fishing  and/or  Hypoplectrus space :  A screenshot proving you visited the challenge system(s), showing the clock.  For example a screenshot of the galaxy map  showing the navigation tab  with your ship's jump range or of your ship's HUD showing the jump-in star. \n For  Poisson d'avril :  A screenshot demonstrating that you completed the challenge.  For example a screenshot showing the canister in proximity to an other ship, or a zoomed-in radar showing that the canister and ship occupy the same space. \n For  Turbot hour :  A screenshot of your ship on the pad at  Fisher Terminal . \n A screenshot of your ship on the pad at either  Poisson Enterprise  or  Poisson Orbital  showing the station clock.  The time shown will be your finish time for the entry. \n For  Thanks for all the fish :  A screenshot of your cargo hold on the pad at the finish line. \n \n Screenshots \nScreenshots may be taken using the in-game screenshot function (F10 key) or your choice of third-party software.  If you are recording a video of your entry you can submit snapshots of individual frames showing each checkpoint. \n \nAlternatively you can submit a link to a video of your race entry.

However some of the waypoint stations are planetary bases so you will need Horizons to visit them.  You can choose a different route if you don't have it.  The Beluga and Regulation Dolphin challenges also require Horizons so you won't be able to attempt them without Horizons. \n \n What about console players? \nConsole players can enter as well. \n \n Do I have to post an intent to race before competing? \nNot if you don't want to.  It's cool if you do, so other racers can look out for you on the course, but it's optional. \n \n Are Engineer modifications allowed in this race? \nYes.  For the  Fish in a barrel  challenge you must not engineer your bulkheads. \n \n Is frameshift drive injection synthesis allowed in this race? \nNo. \n \n I refuse to play in Open \nYou are welcome to run the course in Private Group or Solo mode and submit an entry.  Your attempt will appear on the leaderboard as an exhibition run and be excluded from ranking but you will still be able to compare your efforts to others'. \n \n Just how  \" scrupulously fair \"  is the handicap system for the fish hauling challenge? \nIt should be reasonably fair.  It is designed to be.  Any real or perceived unfairness is due to an oversight or mistake on the part of the race organisers and not a deliberate attempt to favour any particular ship type.  The bonus is calculated from an elaborate formula which is aimed at giving a bigger time bonus to the ships which lose the most jump range from carrying cargo. \n \nThe DBX gets the least bonus and the T9 the most so the system can't be all bad. \n \n Where can I buy fish? \nAnywhere.  But you must buy the fish  after  undocking to start the race and  before  arriving at the first waypoint.  You are allowed to visit challenge systems before buying the fish as long as you have it in your hold when you arrive at each of the  Bass _ ,  Pike _ ,  Ray _  and  Sturgeon _  stations. \n \n Can I substitute rare goods / precious metals / some other cargo for fish? \nNo.

Mhh mhhm mhh mhhmhhh? \nDo I have to remind you that our hunky technician, in addition to that duct tape and zip ties, also carries a large spanner on his extensive tool belt? \nMhhmh mhhhmhhm. \nDon't think so. If your informant is right, this is Pulitzer material. If not - well, it wasn't me who signed the chitties for all this conditionally illegal tech from the store. \nMhhmhhm! \nNow be quiet. It gets interesting. \n.... \n* pling * \n... errrmmm .... \n* PLING * \n... \n Thank you. \nMy dear colleagues, unfortunately I have to tell you that a tasting of this 150 year old Lavian Brandy which we unexpectedly acquired in lieu of overdue dues from a missing, believed dead, pilot, was not the only or even the main reason I invited the inner council to this meeting. \nWe have a problem. \nThe funds of the pilot's federation are slowly, but most definitely bleeding out. It's not only the political situation, with the distinct possiblity of having to run a full scale war against an alien species, this is much worse. If we can't stop this leakage, we will have to take some unpopular, even extreme measures. Our accounting department has been able to pinpoint a few of the major losses. \nFirst of all, there's our annual dinner.... \nQUIET! \nPlease calm down. If we can plug at least one of the other holes, we hopefully won't have to cut into that budget. \nNext, there are the private pilot's insurance claims. I believe we are making some progress here with regard to the large number of Sidewinder claims within various station's local zones. Our recent change in the insurance conditions regarding the loss of Sidewinders within a station's immediate proximity already looks promising, and the impeding general overhaul of the basic insurance handling should see us clear well through the next two quarters. After that, we expect the new detention facilities to be cost neutral by the first quarter of 3305. \nHowever, there's a third problem, concerning our cargo insurance services for the commercial spacelines. We are faced with increasing losses on the cargo insurance, mostly due to breakages claims. It's nothing we can put a finger on, but the actual claims consistently exceed our modelling, eating into our reserves. Either there is some very elaborate insurance fraud going on, or our modelling isn't quite up to scratch. \n ... \n I'm afraid accounting has no idea about how to tackle the last one. We can't just increase the rates, they'll have to match the models or the big three's tax auditors will string us from the next airlock. Accounting cross checked their models and found no errors. If it's fraud, then whoever is doing it is really, really good, probably using insurance models at least as good as ours. The percentage is very small - but multiply it over a few ten thousand systems, and the absolute value skyrockets. \nSo. Anyone got an idea? \n... \n No.   \n... \n Tried that. \n... \n You can't be serious. \n... \n Too risky. We may insure risks, but we won't take them. \n... \n Who would do that? \n... \n B-R-who?   \n... \n Sounds like a win-win-win. They succeed, and we find our leak. They fail, and we get a solid reason to increase our rates and in addition someone to take the blame. Ok. Who's going  to talk to .... \n... \n... \n... \n Hey? Stuff this, the connection broke up. Just when it gets interesting. \nCharlie, you still got your contact in the BRC?  \nMhhh? \nYep. \nMhh mhhm mhh mhh mhh. \nYou'll have to. PF is planning something, and they want the BRC to handle the hot potatoes. So far, so usual. So, if you want that Pulitzer for exposing the PF's machinations, you'd better get in contact. \nMhhm mhh! \nNot necessarily. \" \n \nGetting Cousin Bjorn to put a bug into Charlie deWitt's Orca had definitely been worth the load of Gueuze Beer. So, the PF was again planning to get the BRC to do their dirty work. But what was it this time? \n \n \n \nInvitation \n \n ​ On behalf of the chairman of the Buckyball Racing Club, I would like to invite all active members and interested pilots to an extraordinary meeting \nat the  Escape Bar  &  Grill, Noriega Station, LTT 2151 \non  Friday,  23rd of February  02nd of March 1  3304, 20:00 IGT \n \n \n For the Race Committee \n(signed) A.Elbub \n \n 1 Due to circumstances beyond our control 2 , we were forced to move the date of this meeting by one week. \n \n 2 Actually, Lakon  bribed paid the landlord to reserve the bar for an exclusive event duing the planned race week. Rumor has it that they're going to announce a new ship. ​   \n \n \n \n \n \nEsteemed guests, dear fellow CMDRs of the Buckyball Racing Club, \n \nlet me get straight to the point. You all know that our relations with  the Pilot's Federation have been somewhat strained in the last few  months, perhaps not entirely unconnected to all those insurance claims  put in by BRC members. Now, last week I received a call from the CFO of  the Pilot Federation's insurance branch. You might be aware that the  PF's insurance for private pilots is only a small part of their overall  work, and that they also handle the insurance for the big passenger and  freight companies. \n \nIn this specific branch, they have to rely on models to calculate their  insurance rates, and apparently they have discovered some discrepancies  between those models and their actual payouts. In order to check these  models against reality, they have requested the BRC to supply them with  some baseline data for freight shipping under, what they call,   \" challenging circumstances \" . Since you all did so marvellously with the  fast and high-g landings during last year's  \" Heavy Metal \"  and  \" Prison Break \"   races, I naturally accepted on your behalf. We would just do what we  always do, that is, fly fast, and doing the PF a little favour by  carrying their sensor packets along. Incidentally, and while we're  amongst ourselves, this little favour probably won't hurt our standing  when we will have to negotiate their handling of race related insurance  claims later on this year. Sounds like a win-win. \n \nThe task is simple. Pick up some breakable items, stick one of these  sensor packets in each container, then land at a few planetary bases  with increasing gravity, finally deliver the stuff, still packed up,  together with the sensor packets for analysis to the PF labs here  Noriega Station. If, at any point during this trip, you feel that the  risk becomes too great, just take a shortcut and go to Noriega Station  directly. Piece of cake, actually. Speaking of which, the race  headquarters will be located here in the Escape Bar  &  Grill for the  duration, and I persuaded the PF's CFO to cover the bill for the  participants, so enjoy your drinks. I can wholeheartedly recommend the  Pina Colada. \n \nOne of those sensor packets is attached to your briefing documents. You  can pick up more from the table at the door if you want to do multiple  runs. \n \nFly fast, Commaders. \n \n \n \n \n The Rules \n \n ​ The race will require the participants to start from  Noriega Station in the LTT 2151 system with an empty hold (or at least  not holding any Crystalline Spheres). Fly to Snow Moon in the Bento  system and pick up at least 1 ton of Crystalline Spheres. Now visit the  remaining stations as outlined in the table below, in order:  \n \n \n \n Distance \n System \n Planet \n Station \n Gravity \n remarks \n 0 LTT 2151 - Noriega Station - Start 24.9 ly + 387 ls Bento - Snow Moon - pick up Crystalline Spheres 44.9 ly + 1443 ls Okinura Okinura 8C Korniyenko Terminal 0.10 g calibration 24.9 ly + 106 ly Blatrimpe Blatrimpe 7 Koch Beacon 1.06 g mandatory 35.9 ly + 194 ls Shoujeman Shoujeman 5 Baffin Plant 2.13 g +32 minutes 22.1 ly + 123 ls Wolf 562 Laila's Memory King's Inheritance 2.87 g +24 minutes 29.9 ly + 155 ls 5 G.

Capricorni 3 Moore Beacon 3.99 g +16 minutes 57.2 ly + 12 ls Ross 905 Robert Kelley Weber Legacy 4.74 g +8 minutes 49.4 ly + 210 ls LTT 2151 - Noriega Station - Finish \n \nAll stations on the way offer at least repair and refuelling services,  and you're free to use those. If you feel that you've had enough, you  can abort the run at any point after Koch Beacon and return to Noriega  Station directly. However, doing so will add a penalty of 8 minutes per  station missed to your race time - and it's not permitted to e.g. miss a  couple of stations inbetween and claim the last station on the list. \n \nThis is a round trip race, starting and finishing in Noriega Station in LTT 2151. \n \n Options ​ \nSince this race practically shouts for it, I'll also throw in the   \" shieldless suicide \"  bonus. Complete the race in a shieldless ship (and  without an AFMU!) and you'll receive a 3 minutes bonus on your time.  Repairing at the waypoints is still permitted (basically because I can't  enforce that). However - complete the race with  less than   10% (proof required) hull left (and the Crystalline Spheres still in  your hold!), and you'll get the  \" crash pilot \"  bonus of 3 minutes ( see amendment below  - the damage must have been present at the last planetary base you docked). Both  boni may also be claimed in the Healthy Hauler class (in which case, of  course, you will have to leave out the shield generator). \n \n Ship Classes ​ \nThis race will permit two ship classes. Either class may be flown in any  of the game modes, although I would encourage you to fly in Open mode.  Main interference will most likely be from NPC pirates. With the  Crystalline Spheres in your hold, expect at least one or two  interdiction attempts on each run. \n \nOpen Unlimited: anything except FSD boost synthesis permitted.  \n \nHealthy Hauler: your basic Hauler with an upgraded loadout. All of it  available at Noriega Station. However, they do not sell heatsinks here,  so be careful  . \n \n \n Weapons: none Utility: none Core: 1C lightweight alloy 2D power plant 2B thrusters 2A FSD 1D life support 1D power distributor 1D sensors Optional: 3E cargo rack 2D shields (may be omitted for the  \" shieldless suicide \"  option) \n \n Coriolis link . \n Required documentation \n ​ \n \n screenshot of your inventory while docked in Noriega station (without Crystalline Spheres)  \n for those claiming the shieldless suicide bonus or  competing in the Healthy Hauler class, a screenshot of your ship's  module panel showing all relevant modules (or the lack thereof, may  require multiple shots)  \n starting screenshot docked at Noriega Station with station clock visible  \n screenshot docked at Snow Moon, with station clock visible  \n ...  \n and so on - screenshot docked at every station on the way  in the above order until back at Noriega Station, with the time visible  \n final screenshot of your inventory at Noriega Station (with Crystalline Spheres)  \n   \nIn total, that's a minimum of 11 screenshots, plus whatever neccessary for loadout options and/or bonus claims. \n \nAlternatively, as usual, a video showing all the above details is also acceptable. \n \n Amended as of 05.03.3304, 18:30 IGT:  submitted material must have legible time stamps/a legible cockpit clock. An image size of 311x172 pixels is not sufficient. \n \n Amended as of 06.03.3304, 09:35 IGT:  in order to qualify for the Crash Pilot bonus, you must show  < 10% hull at the last planetary port you docked at  and  when arriving at the finish line at Noriega Station. It has been pointed out that otherwise, you could willfuly just smash against the station immediately before landing (not that anyone would do this...) \n \n Amended as of 09.03.3304, 20:50 IGT : The Bruski rule: each race submission must use an independent image album (or video, or otherwise set of screenshots). No mixing up of multiple runs in one album (video, set, whatever). \n \n \n Race Entry Form \n \n \n ​ Fly fast, CMDRs - just remember that you'll have to bring those Crystalline Spheres back to

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n A time-trial race event open for nine days on all gaming platforms. A test of skill for interstellar ambulance pilots and speed enthusiasts of all kinds. ​ The Story: \n“Alright candidates, listen up.” \n \nThe pilot briefing room aboard Harris Hospital Station fell silent as the Director of the Interstellar Ambulance Group approached a podium in front of the newest class of Commanders seeking to earn the  silver-winged caduceus . They had come a long way during training, but the final challenge remained. \n \n“As demonstrated by the growing threats facing humanity throughout occupied space, the need for competent ambulance pilots has never been greater. As we saw out in the Pleiades, anyone can stuff a T-9 full of scared station inhabitants and truck them out to a waiting megaship, but severely injured people can’t travel that way. We need true medical evacuation ships, with flight paramedics and proper equipment on board, that can keep patients alive on the way to a full size medical installation. Our predecessors learned this in battle, and their call sign was ‘DUSTOFF’. The first among them pioneered the use of early VTOL craft called helicopters for this purpose. They pulled patients out of murky jungles, or off the side of cliffs, or from stricken vessels at sea. You will follow in their footsteps, for after all these centuries, the only real difference in our work is scale. When there’s an accident at an asteroid mining outpost, or workers are injured constructing a starport, the only thing that can bridge the light-years between them and the nearest hospital station is a speedy ship. \n \n“Today you will undertake the practical check-flight, which is designed to test your skills in all medevac mission tasks. You will work the navigation systems while making rapid approaches and departures; you will respond to incidents on planetary surfaces and in orbit. If you control your nerves and prevent simple mistakes, you will succeed. \n \n“You will be flying the Dolphin Standard Space Ambulance, and we will see who finishes at the top of the class. However, to make things more interesting I’ve invited the most reckless- er, daring pilot organization in the galaxy, the Buckyball Racing Club, to set times in their highly customized ships. Let’s see if any of you can beat them by skill and wit, in which case you might get an early upgrade to the Diamondback Advanced Rescue Ambulance. This will also be a perfect opportunity to see if any of those racing pilots can put together a build that is faster and cheaper than what we’ve been using, or at least demonstrate the viability of modified drives to the Safety Board. \n \n“You’ll find the necessary mission information is being transferred to you flight computers now. I suggest you review the route and parameters carefully. Good luck Commanders.” \n \n Memorial Station Names History: \n Charles L. Kelly  was a U.S. Army pilot during the Vietnam War, and was the Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance). He was called  \" Crazy Kelly \"  and  \" Mad Man Kelly \"  for his willingness to fly into danger to rescue the wounded. \n \nKelly was killed in action on July 1, 1964, when, after being urged by troops on the ground to depart a dangerous landing zone even though not everyone had been loaded on board yet, he replied,  \" When I have your wounded- \"  and was cut off by a bullet that pierced his heart. The rest of his crew survived the subsequent crash and were rescued. \n \nLater on, an officer tossed the bullet which had killed Kelly on a desk in front of his successor,  Patrick Henry Brady , and asked if they were going to stop flying so aggressively. Brady picked up the bullet and replied,  \" we are going to keep flying exactly the way Kelly taught us to fly, without hesitation, anytime, anywhere. \" \n \nOn his second tour of duty, Brady was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. ( Read the citation ) He flew over 2,000 combat missions and evacuated more than 5,000 wounded personnel. He eventually retired as a Major General on September 1, 1993. \n Race Rules: \n \n Ship Classes: \nThere are two classes, and Commanders can compete in either or both. \n \n The Dolphin Standard Class , which must match the linked build exactly, engineer modification is not allowed. \nThe ship and all relevant modules can be found at Velazquez Ring in LTT 17102, not far from Miola. \n \nThe Experimental Class, which must adhere to the following: \n- Small or Medium Ship \n- Less than 5 million Cr baseline ship cost (hull only, modules may exceed this) \n- Excluding the Dolphin and Diamondback Explorer (already existing ambulance platforms) \nList of authorized ships: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Sidewinder \nEagle \nHauler \nAdder \nImperial Eagle \nViper \nCobra Mk III \nViper Mk IV \nDiamondback Scout \nCobra Mk IV \nType-6 Transporter \nImperial Courier \nKeelback \nAsp Scout \nVulture ​ \n\t\t \n\t \n - Required Modules: 1E cargo rack (2T capacity only), any SRV hangar, and any fuel scoop \n- Shields and/or upgraded hull strength are recommended, but not required \n- Engineer modified modules ARE allowed \n- Collector limpet controllers are NOT allowed \n- Offensive weaponry is NOT allowed \n \n Race Sequence: \nBegin with your ship docked in Miola, at Harris Hospital. Time starts when you launch from here. \nComplete the following missions as quickly as possible, considering the 2T cargo capacity limit: \n \nMedical Resupply Request: The small clinic at Kelly Legacy has run out of donor blood for transfusions and needs you to bring fresh supplies from Harris Hospital immediately. \n What: 1T of any cargo from the commodities market \nFrom: Miola, Harris Hospital \nTo: Asgara, A 1 a, Kelly Legacy ​ Planetary Evacuation Request: Listening posts have picked up an emergency-locator-transponder signal from these coordinates, find the downed ship and bring the pilot to Zelano Medical Installation for evaluation. \n What: 1T of cargo found at the pick up site \nFrom: Leucos, A 5 a, -36.128, -45.243 \nTo: Zelano, A 4, Medical Installation ​ Interfacility Patient Transfer Request: This patient has just come out of surgery at Brady Station but needs to be transferred to the long term intensive care unit at Zelano Medical Installation to have hope of a full recovery. \n What: 1T of any cargo from the commodities market \nFrom: Triton, Brady Station \nTo: Zelano, A 4, Medical Installation ​ Deep Space Evacuation Request: Anonymous eyewitness reports indicate that a vicious battle was fought here, so beware of debris and hostile ships. Survivors may be in bad shape so bring them directly to Harris Hospital. \n What: 1T of cargo found at the signal source \nFrom: Algol, A 3, Unidentified Signal Source \nTo: Miola, Harris Hospital ​ \nTime stops when all missions are complete and you touch down at Harris Hospital, ready for follow on assignments. \n \n General Rules and Notes: \n-One ton of any type of cargo will suffice as a mock ‘patient’ or ‘load of medical supplies’ for this challenge. \n(something theme appropriate might not be available in the commodities markets or at the crash sites) \n-You are limited to a single flight paramedic, so a maximum of two ‘patients’ may be carried on board simultaneously. \n(1E grade, 2T capacity cargo rack limit for both race classes) \n-Although all stations on this route support large ships, interstellar ambulances must be able to respond to outposts. \n(Only small or medium size ships *excluding Dolphin and DBX* are authorized for the Experimental Class) \n-Patients on planet surfaces must be retrieved to your ship using the SRV. \n-Patients in space must be retrieved using the cargo scoop. (no limpet controllers) \n-Zelano Medical Installation utilizes a special airlock tunnel to rapidly handle incoming ambulances without the need for standard docking procedures. Simply fly into the tunnel, stop near the center, jettison your cargo, and continue. \n-The crash site on Leucos, A 5 a, -36.128, -45.243 has scannable points that will cause it to appear on your nav panel for future reference after your first visit (see Bonus Challenge below). \n-NS/WD boosting is allowed, but you may not begin the race pre-charged from a double boost. \n-Jumponium FSD injection is not allowed. \n-The race may be run in any game mode, but it is fun to play it in open. It is highly likely that you will encounter other friendly Buckyballers, and unlikely that you will encounter hostile players at the race checkpoints. \n \n Schedule: \nThe race will be open for  9   10  days, from 00:00:01 UTC on 27 January 3304 to 23:59:59 UTC on 5 February 3304. There is no limit on the number of attempts/submissions per racer; each person’s fastest time in a given class will be marked on the leaderboard. Entries will be accepted for up to 24 hours following the close of the race, after which the rankings will be finalized. \n \n Submission Info: \nBefore you begin, it is customary (but not required) to post a reply in this thread declaring your intent to race by stating your CMDR name (if different from forum name), race class, ship type, and ship name. For bonus fun, post a picture of an air ambulance from your country or city of origin, and attempt to match the paintwork on your ship, for example: \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \nThe Swiss use a typical red/white but you will find a huge variety by image searching for various countries/cities. ​ \nRace entries may be submitted via  this form  where you will be asked to provide a link to your evidence of completing the race. This may be a video or set of screenshots hosted publicly at a site such as youtube or imgur. \n \nIf using screenshots to verify your entry, the following are required and the clock must be visible in #2-#8: \n 1. Ship Modules Panel (required regardless of entry class) \n2. Docked in Harris Hospital (don’t forget to load 1T ‘medical supplies’) \n3. Docked at Kelly Legacy, with ‘cargo jettisoned’ displayed \n4. In SRV on Leucos A 5 a, with ‘cargo acquired’ displayed \n5. Docked at Brady Station, with the commodities page open (load 1T ‘patient’) \n6. In the tunnel at Zelano Medical Installation, speed less than 30m/s with ‘cargo jettisoned’ displayed \n7. In the Unidentified Signal Source near Algol A 3, with ‘cargo acquired’ displayed \n8. Docked at Harris Hospital ​ \n Bonus Challenge: Master Navigator \nThe crash site at Leucos, A 5 a, -36.128, -45.243 will have to be found by traditional compass and coordinate navigation on your first visit. However, once you scan it’s data points with your SRV, it will be saved in your nav panel and may be selected and flown directly on subsequent runs. Since some players may have visited and scanned this site in the course of their regular gameplay prior to the event, and there is no way to verify that players are not using this expedient without video, it is the default method for the race. This bonus challenge is simple, but a video-capture method of submission is required. Fly the race without scanning the crashed ship, so that you have to arrive at the site purely by manual navigation. Prove to the world that you have orbital cruise flight! Don’t just  win  the race, win it  in style . CMDRs that take on this bonus option will be highlighted on the leaderboards for bragging rights (or an additional board will be established if interest is high). \n \n Leaderboards:

graceful arc. \n \n \" How you doin' Daily, long time no see! \" \n \n \" Delia please! only my staff call me Daily \" \n \n \" Jeez, the last time I saw you must have been over 2 years ago, back when we put on that Buckyball Race ... what was it called again? \" \n \n \" The Bump 'n' Grind Outpost Dash  ... utter chaos from start to finish ... fancy doing another one? \" \n \nBarnum started to laugh but a subtle arch of the woman's eyebrows stopped him in his tracks. \n \n \" Oh god, you're actually serious ... what have you got in mind? \" \n \n \" Well last week I was checking up on a few remote outposts where I have ... errr, let's just say, vested interests, and this hit-and-run punk took a pot-shot at me and blew out my tharging canopy. Luckily I had the 'A' grade life support so no biggie but as I was running for the nearest station with that damn O2 timer counting down my last 25 minutes of air I found myself thinking - hell, I could probably just finish doing my rounds and still make it home with time to spare. \n \nI didn't of course, I'm not completely insane, but then I thought - no, but I know a bunch of space jockeys who are and I know just the person to encourage them to give it a try. Hell, make some deals with the shipyards and insurance brokers and you might just turn a profit while you're at it? \" \n \n \" Oh I don't know Delia, I'm getting too old for all that malarky and besides, I have more than enough money to see out the rest of this life I reckon'! \" \n \n \" Shame ... it woulda' been nice to see the name 'Bump' Barnum back in Galnet news one more time, it'd make a pleasant change from all this tedious Aegis nonsense. Ah well, take care of yourself Bump! \" \n \nAnd with that she was gone, back into the bustle of the starport. Barnum turned back to his drink and caught the eye of the bartender who was looking at him curiously. \n \n \" Same again please kid ... oh, and by the way, about Miss Grind - it's not a good idea to overhear too much of what she says! If she doesnt have you killed personally then following her crazy ideas might do the job just as well. Flying on life support's no joking matter, people die doing that kinda thing! What's your name anyway, you're new here aren't you? \" \n \n \" The name's Jak sir \"  said the bartender as he turned to pour another gin.  \" It's none of my business really, reckon' my flying days are over anyway, but ... that race? If I was a Buckyballer, hell I'd be all over that like a Thargon swarm! \" \n \nWith a wink he put the drink down on a fresh coaster in front of the man and headed off into the back room, calling over his shoulder as he went. \n \n \" That one's on the house mate! \" \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n Rules \n \n The race begins at Vo Dock in the LHS 142 system (one of Mr Obsidian Ant's personal favourites and you'll soon see why). You need to be docked and have an 'A' class life support fitted (the one that gives you 25 minutes of emergency Oxygen). \n \nThe objective of this race is to fly to as many remote outposts as you can in the time afforded to you by that life support and make it back to Vo Dock before your air runs out. At each outpost you successfully dock at (more on this in a minute) you get to add that system's distance from LHS 142 to your score. \n \nNote: you must stick to outposts only as it's not possible to enter the controlled atmosphere of a large station without stopping the emergency Oxygen countdown. \n \nFor example, suppose you locate 3 systems which are 170ly, 180ly and 190ly away from LHS 142 with 1 outpost in the first system and 2 each in the 2nd and 3rd, and suppose you land at all 5 outposts (in whatever order seems best) and then successfully return to Vo Dock without suffocating. Your final score would be 910 (1x170 + 2x180 + 2x190). \n \nSo ... plan your route, setup your bookmarks and then get yourself on the launch pad at Vo Dock, facing the right direction and ready to fly. Go to your modules list in the right-hand panel, select life support and turn it OFF. Don't panic! The Oxygen countdown won't start until you exit the station. \n \nWhenever you're ready, launch and head on out. As soon as the blue O2 countdown appears, take a screenshot that shows the current time, the countdown timer and your current location at Vo Dock. Unusually for a Buckyball race I don't really care about your actual launch time. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nNow fly to each of your chosen outposts. When you arrive at each outpost, land, take another screenshot showing the station clock and your O2 countdown, and then select Launch to head off again. Don't worry, simply turning around on the pad without fully entering the station will not restore your Oxygen and the countdown should continue uninterrupted. Do NOT select Enter Hangar. \n \nKeep an eye on the clock and leave yourself (just) enough time to get back to the start. When you've visited as many outposts as you dare, head back to LHS 142 and the safety of Vo Dock. Take a screenshot as you're approaching the mail slot which shows the current time, the countdown timer and the location, then land and take one final screenshot showing the station clock (to prove you actually made it safely back inside). \n \nYou must not replenish or otherwise halt or reset your emergency O2 countdown at any point during the run except when you finally pass back through the mail slot at Vo Dock. Any indication that you've done so will invalidate your run. If you find you have not left yourself enough time to get safely back inside Vo Dock you can either push on regardless and hope for the best or choose to abandon the run and turn your life support back on. \n \nThere will be a special  \" Very Last Gasp \"  trophy for anyone submitting a Vo Dock screenshot showing 0:01 on the countdown clock. This award will come in blue and red varieties. The blue one is for pilots who's screenshot is part of a successful race submission. The red one ... well, you can probably work out what the red one is for! \n \n Bonus distance \n \nIn order to add an (admittedly small) incentive to try and re-run your route faster (in classic Buckyball tradition) you will get 1 bonus ly added to your total distance for every 2 seconds of O2 remaining in your penultimate Vo Dock mailslot screenshot. This does mean of course that you could simply take off, turn around and fly straight back in again to achieve a score of 750ly but no self respecting Buckyballer would ever do such a thing ... would they? \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n Race Classes \n \n I'll be maintaining scoreboards for two different race classes. \n \nFor the  Unlimited  class you can use any type of ship and outfitting you like (as long as you have an 'A' class life support). The ship can be engineered and you can use white dwarf/neutron supercharged jumps but you can NOT use FSD injection. \n \nFor the  Regulation Hauler  class you must fly a Hauler outfitted exactly as follows: \n \n \n 2D thrusters \n 2D shields \n 1A life support \n 1D power distributor \n 2A FSD \n 3D fuel scoop \n 1D sensors \n 2D power plant \n \n Coriolis link for regulation Hauler outfitting \n \nThe regulation Hauler must NOT be engineered and you can NOT use FSD injection however you are still allowed to use white dwarf/neutron supercharged jumps if you wish to do so. \n \nAlthough the Hauler itself can be purchased at Vo Dock in LHS 142, you'll need to fly to the nearby Archambault Hub in G 268-47 to fit all the necessary modules. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n Submitting your race entries \n \n To submit your race entries (you can run the race as many times as you like throughout the duration of the race and may enter in both classes if you wish) upload your set of screenshots to an image hosting website such as imgur.com. Then drop me a pm here on the forums (or send me an email at  alec.turner@buckyballracing.org.uk ) with a subject line of  \" Last Gasp -  < your commander name > \"  and the following details in the body of the message: \n \n \n Your commander name. \n Your forum name (if different). \n The race class (Unlimited or Regulation Hauler). \n The name of your ship. \n A link to the imgur album (or other) containing your set of screenshots for this run. \n The list of system names for the outposts you flew to (these should be repeated if you landed at more than one outpost in the same system) along with the distance between each system and LHS 142 plus the total scoring distance that you're claiming for your run. \n \nI'll be checking those distances along with your maths but it will really help if you include them as a guide (it's rare but Buckyball Race marshals have been known to make mistakes in the past). \n \nIf you're flying in the regulation Hauler class then I'll also need a screenshot of the modules tab in the right-hand panel taken either just before or just after your run. \n \nI will accept any entries where the time shown in the first screenshot (taken just after you exit Vo Dock) is between 00:00:00 on 06.01.3304 and 23:59:59 on 14.01.3304. \n \nLastly, to register your intent to take part in this race please post in this thread and complete the following sentence: \n \n If I only had 25 minutes left to live I would ... ​ \n \n FAQ \n \n Q) Could you also use Megaships providing that you do not select Enter Hangar? \nA) No - although it would work I've decided not to allow megaships since there's a danger that moving megaships and/or the appearance of new megaships if and when more stations come under attack by Thargoids could significantly alter the landscape of the race during the course of the event. \n \nQ) Are plantery ports not allowed? \nA) I did test that and it would work (i.e. you can turn around on the pad without restoring O2) but, for the sake of keeping things fair for people without horizons, I'm gonna say no again ... sorry. \n \nQ) Can I restock my life support with mats? \nA) Absolutely not! \n \nQ) Can I visit the same station more than once? \nA) No. \n \nQ) Alec, Is it really a good idea to change the rules mid-race after a night down the pub? \nA) Yes. \n \nIf you have any further questions then post them here in this thread and I'll add them to the FAQ. ​ \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n

will  continue until Monday, December  18 , 3303 at 23:59:59.  All entries must  be run during that time.  Submissions will be allowed up to Tuesday,  December  19 , 3303 at 23:59:59; however, all entries must be raced at  some point between December 5 and December  18 .  \n \n 1.      You will need Horizons   for this, as this involves SRV racing.  You will also need some method   of video capture, recording, and dissemination, such as Twitch or Youtube. \n   2.      Take your ship to   Dav’s Hope.  It can be found in Hyades Sector DR-V C2-23, A5,   coordinates 44.818 / -31.389.  Note that Dav’s Hope isn’t selectable as a   location, as it is an abandoned settlement.  Land your ship outside of   the settlement. \n   3.      Drive your SRV to the   main gates at the front of Dav's Hope.  Stop within the main entrance   gate.  This is the starting (and finish) line; this is where you will   start your run.  More information on Dav's Hope can be found  here  and  here .  At this time, I recommend checking your materials within inventory to see if you can fit 30 more items within. \n   4.       Once done, I   recommend going into the main menu at this time, making sure to turn on   your recording or streaming, then going back into the game in either   solo mode or private group.  The reason for this… some of the materials   you’re required to collect have a habit of rolling sometimes, and the   sooner you get to them, the better.  Because, well… that’s the point of   this race: collecting all of the materials in the station.  And, if   someone else in open play or in private group has picked up the   materials, that’s going to be marked as a penalty.   Also, if it is in   open, it is likely that such behavior will annoy other CMDRs there to   gather materials. \n   5.      From the moment you accelerate from a stopped position at the gate, the clock starts.   \n   6.      There are 10 sets of   materials in the station, set at various locations within.  Start at  the  entrance gate to Dav’s Hope.  Collect all 10 sets of materials as  fast  as possible, then race back to the main gate.  The clock will  continue  to run until the SRV has crossed the main gate again.   \n   7.      Materials set within   the station by entities other than Frontier Developments will not  count.   The places where these materials materialize are marked and  known, as  shown in the  link  included above. \n   8.      If you fail to   collect all 10 sets of materials within the station, you will be   assessed the following penalty, based on the number missed: \n   a.      1 missed: 5 second penalty \n   b.      2 missed: 15 second penalty \n   c.       3 missed: 30 second penalty \n   d.      4 missed: 50 second penalty \n   e.      5 missed: 75 second penalty \n   f.       Any additional missed: an added 30 second penalty. \n   9.      Yes, I realize this   means that a person could potentially turn in a time of 3 minutes and 45   seconds just by turning their name in.  Anyone who turns in a time of 3   minutes and 45 seconds will be officially given the Couch Potato  award.    \n10. Once completed, post the video to video sharing or streaming site, such as Youtube or Twitch. \n   11.  When you turn in your result, please turn in the following, either through private message to me or to my  email address : \n   a.      Forum name \n   b.      CMDR name \n   c.       SRV name \n   d.      Estimated raw time \n   e.      Number of materials collected \n   f.       Estimated revised time \n   g.  Link to the video of the posted run \n   h.      Favorite Land Racing Vehicle (Real or fictional) \n   12.  If there is a tie to the   nearest second – and, given the shortness of this race, there may be –   any tie will be broken with the use of a stopwatch by the race  organizer  and consultation with other BRC officials.   \n   13.  A leaderboard will be posted and updated daily; however, times will not be posted until the race is completed \n \nADDENDUM: \nIf you are unable to post a video, the following rules apply.  After some discussion, screenshots can be used as  proof if the following 14 screenshots are included: \n \n1: A screenshot of the number of materials in storage before start. \n2: Standing start at gate. \n3-12: One screenshots just after each item is picked up, when it shows the text on-screen indicating the pick-up. \n13: Finish - crossing the gate. \n14: A screenshot of the number of materials in storage after start. \n \nGood luck!

However, the order in which individual countries would participate in the project was not established. Natural candidates were Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) as the most technologically advanced countries and having the most significant contribution to the work of Interkosmos. Erich Honecker, the leader of the German Democratic Republic, pressed for his country to be given priority, for at that time the West German physicist Ulf Merbold was assigned to the first non-American astronaut and Honecker was determined for East German citizen to be the first in orbit. \n \nHowever, after the intervention of representatives of the People's Republic of Poland, which used economic and historical arguments representing Poland as the main trading partner and ally in the fight against the Third Reich, Moscow finally decided that representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland would be the first in space. The decision was of a political nature - in both countries the social situation was unfavorable to the authorities (the dissenting movement of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and protests due to the announced price increases in Poland) and an event that would divert the attention of the public. \n \nIn the same year, Hermaszewski was selected by a selection of several hundred Polish pilots as a candidate for a space flight. Finally elected, on the 4th December 1976 he flies to Star City near Moscow, where he prepares for a space flight. From 27 June to 5 July 1978 he took a flight on Soyuz 30. On the 28th June 1978 a mooring with the orbital team  \" Salut 6 \"  - Soyuz 29 was conducted. After the research program, landings took place on 5 July in the steppes of Kazakhstan. During the 8-day mission, there were 126 laps of Earth and several Polish records approved by the FAI were established; Height - 363 km, speed of flight - 28000 km/h, flight time - 190h 3m 4s, distance traveled - 5,273,257 km amongts others. \n \nMirosław Hermaszewski was awarded the Golden Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union (No. 11 301), the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Cross of the Grunwald Class. In 1986 he became a Knight of the  Order of Smile . \n \n Source:  Wikipedia \n \n RULES \n \nThe race will take place between  10-19 November 3303 . It's a Time Trial race, so participants must go around the established route (see below) docking at each station. On each station you need to take a screenshot so that the name of the station, the time and the fact that the ship is docked can be clearly seen (see example on the  How to Enter page of the Buckyball Racing Club website ). \n \nThe course starts and finishes at  Hermaszewski Station  in  Arthaiyati . After departing from Arthaiyati, racers must call at the following stations, in order, before returning to finish back at Hermaszewski Station in Arthaiyati: \n \n Ugraswar - Hermaszewski Ring \n LP 102-320 - Hermaszewski Resort \n Hamal - Hermaszewski Dock \n Buzhang Ku - Hermaszewski Hub \n Barathaona - Hermaszewski Gateway \n Serre - Hermaszewski Orbital \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nYou should submit a total of 8 screenshots (2 of them from Hermaszewski Station - to start and finish the race). Instead of screenshots, you can also submit a video of your run. The player with the shortest flight time wins the race. \n \nThe race takes place in two categories:  Adder Class  and  Free For All . For Adder Class the following build must be used (the screenshot of it must also be included in the set of screens from the station - or it must be shown in the video). In the FFA second class you can fly any vessel of your choice, with or without engineering. You can take any number of flights on the route within the specified time frame. \n \n \n ADDER CLASS \n \nIn this class we fly the  Adder  ship with  this specific build .

Sorry father. \"  Thor mumbled, scratching his orange, mead-stained beard. \n \" If you could just stop thinking of Jarnsaxa for one minute and listen, you would be back in the mead hall in no time. And I wouldn't have to explain this to you again! \" \n \" Sure. I'll listen this time. \"  Thor sighed, slightly more motivated. \n \" As you know, the thargoids are back. We... \" \n \" The who? \" \n \" The alien plant things! \" \n \" Oh, those. \" \n \" ...must do something. Humanity has grown soft and complacent. They won't stand a chance unless they toughen up! \" \n \" Was it Loki's idea to require permit to land on Valhalla? Almost no one ever comes here now. \"  Thor interrupted. \n \" Well, we did want to keep the riffraff out. \"  Odin explained, remembering who's idea it actually was. \n \" What about Frey? Wasn't he trying to interact with the mortals. I remember him saying something about a race... \" \n \" He crashed Skíðblaðnir last week. In the Wasat system. Now he's sitting in Alfheim, sulking. \" \n \" Figures. Damned Vanir! They can't do anything right! \" \n \" Obviously not. Sif married you, didn't she? \" \n \" Ouch. That was a stab in the back, father! \" \n \" Well, if you stopped putting your sword in the wrong sheath, I'm sure she would speak to you again. Eventually. \" \n \" She's overreacting! \" \n \" Whatever. But we've got more pressing matters to attend to than your family problems. We must do something. Now. \" \n \" But what? \" \n \" I think Frey was onto something with the racing idea. There's an organisation, the Buckyball Racing Club. It unites Valhalla-worthy pilots from all planets and affiliations. If we can use them to gain a little publicity... \" \n \" A race, eh? Will there be lots of mead, crashes and pretty wenches? \" \nOdin sighed. \n\t\t \n\t \n Valhalla Unltd. is sponsoring a race in honour of the ancient norse religion originating from the northern part of the European continent on Earth. Nowadays the religion is mainly extinct, but some enclaves remain, mainly in settlements with north-european and japanese ethnicity. A spokesperson from the Valhalla Unltd. stated the following during the press release: \n \" Listen up everyone! Go out there. Win or die trying. Now, where's the mead and the wenches? \" \n \n Declaring your intent to race: \n \nOptional, but encouraged. \nState your CMDR name, your ship name and ship type. If possible, include a battle cry. \n \nEven more optional: Blot to the gods! \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t To ensure the favour of the gods, you should perform a sacrifice (a blot). \nYou may blot any amount of the following goods: \nBeer \nAnimal meat \nFish \nSlaves \nWitchhaul Kobe Beef \nAlbino Quechua Mammoth Meat \nBuckyball Beer Mats \n \nThe blot should be performed in one of the following systems: \nThor (63 ly from sol) \nThor's eye (4229 ly from sol) \nOdin's Wisdom (918 ly from sol) \nNjordr (72 ly from sol) \nTyr (86 ly from sol) \nFrey (109 ly from sol) \nFreyr (56 ly from sol) \n \nYou make the blot by dropping out of supercruise in the choosen system and jettison the cargo. \nAdd a screenshot of your blot to your intent to race. \n \nFAQ \nQ: I want to ensure the favour of the gods. May I blot every type of cargo at every system in the list? \nA: Sure. But one screenshot is enough. \n \nQ: I'm a cheapskate. I only want to blot 1 ton of beer in the system closest to my current location. Is this OK? \nA: It's OK with me. Unless Thor strikes you down with a lightning bolt, it's OK with him too. \n \nQ: I'm a vegan. May I blot fruit and vegetables instead? \nA: Interesting experiment. Why don't you go ahead and try? \n \nQ: Ops! I forgot to blot and I have already begun racing! What do I do now? \nA: As the blot is considered part your intent to race, it is in fact optional. You may skip it or do it at any time during the race. \n \nQ: Should I blot for each ship I fly in the race? \nA: No, once is enough. \n \nQ: My religion prohibits me from making sacrifices to other deities, even in games. Since I cannot blot, does this mean I can't participate? \nA: As mentioned above, the blot is optional. If you are uncomfortable with it, just skip it. \n\t\t \n\t \n The race takes place in the norse cosmology. This map shows all the details: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n You may race in one or both of the two classes described below: \n \n    The Squirrel \n \nRatatoskr is a squirrel who runs up and down the world tree Yggdrasil to carry messages between the eagle and the hawk Veðrfölnir, perched atop Yggdrasil, and the dragon Níðhöggr. Can you do it faster? Of course you can! But you need to be a bird to do it. \n \nIn this race you must fly one of the following ships. Note the exact specifications.

Well, cons mostly. \n The Eagle \n The Imperial Eagle \n The Vulture \n \n You can buy the ships here \n \nEngineer mods, jumponium synthesis and NS / WD FSD boosting are not allowed. \n Heat sink synthesis not allowed. \n \n The route \n \nStart at  Lee Survey, Ratatosk . \nVisit the three Norns ( Urd, Skuld and Verðandi ) in any order.

Norse themed BRC race  YGGDRASIL  from 21-29 October 3303, and CMDR Jak is running the  BRC Road Rally Racing, season 1  until the end of December. \n \nFor details of all scheduled BRC events and a history of all past events please take a look at the  www.buckyballracing.org.uk  website. \n \nFly fast CMDRs! o7 \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Long time Buckyball Racing fans Anthony  \" Fat Tony \"  Lonnigan and Enoch  \" Little Nuk \"  Lonnigan - AKA the Lonnigan Brothers - have just finished their time in Hughes Enterprise Jail [Kunti] for a minor misunderstanding about 200 tons of Tarach Spice found in their warehouse after the 3301 Bootlegger Challenge.  Warden Kitty Bomb of the EDA Kunti League runs the best prison that the Lonnigan Bros ever spent time in, but after nearly two years behind bars they need to relax and have a bit of a party before they get down to the serious business of getting their criminal empire back on track and revamping the Bootlegger Challenge and Black Riband. \n \nCoincidentally they heard that the Buckyball Racing Club had recently completed fifty successful racing events (as best as any of those maniacs can count anyway), so what better way to celebrate their freedom than a Festival of Racing? Preferably a racing festival with a few crazy rule tweaks so that Nuk can see a few racers go boom (or maybe just have their ships melt around them while dancing to heavy rock music). \n \nTheir normal haunt of Weyl Gateway in the Alacarakmo system is right out at the edge of the bubble, so for this event the Lonnegan Brothers took a rare trip closer to the middle of the bubble, picking Brash Dock in the Siren system because every Buckyball Racer loves gravity braking past a twin Earthlike. Don't worry Tony and Nuk will be back at Weyl Gateway for the revamped Bootlegger Challenge right after the festival finishes. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n Fat Tony and Little Nuk - The Lonnegan Brothers ​ \n \n \n THE FESTIVAL \n \nThe festival includes three separate races, each requiring roughly 20-30 minutes in an optimal and engineered ship - The Station Scramble, The Bubble Tour and The Wasat Rally. Each of these races begins and ends at Brash Dock in the Siren System. A different ship can be used for each race, with an SRV hangar plus Scarab SRV required for the Wasat Rally. An overall leaderboard will give a combined time, using each commander's best time for each of the three races. \n \nAdditionally racers may enter the Ironbucky Trophy a limited number of times during the festival. Ironbucky Trophy runs require the commander to attempt to complete The Station Scramble, The Bubble Tour and The Wasat Rally in a single session without making repairs or using synthesis. A single ship swap can be made during the run while docked at Brash Dock, but no outfitting changes, so one ship must be fitted with an SRV hangar. Ironbucky runs require pre-registration of an approximate starting time, and the run must begin no more than 15 minutes after this time. A maximum of five attempts per commander can be made in the Ironbucky Trophy - one during the opening weekend, two during the final weekend and one additional run taken at any time during each half of the festival (one in the first half, one in the second half). The 15 minute starting window gives a limited opportunity to restart after an early mistake. \n \n \n \n SUMMARY: \n \nOver the course of the Festival racers have the opportunity to win the following categories: \n \n \n The Ironbucky Trophy: \n Open Unlimited Class \n Cobra Classic Class \n \n Festival of Racing: \n Open Unlimited Class - Fastest Overall Time \n Open Unlimited Class - The Station Scramble \n Open Unlimited Class - The Bubble Tour \n Open Unlimited Class - The Wasat Rally \n Cobra Classic Class - Fastest Overall Time \n Cobra Classic Class - The Station Scramble \n Cobra Classic Class - The Bubble Tour \n Cobra Classic Class - The Wasat Rally \n \n Additional Events: \n Wasat Cup SRV Section - Fastest Time (from all modes / events) \n Open Unlimited Class - Fat Tony's Barbeque Challenge \n Open Unlimited Class - Little Nuk's Dangerous Landings Challenge \n Cobra Classic Class - Fat Tony's Barbeque Challenge \n Cobra Classic Class - Little Nuk's Dangerous Landings Challenge \n \n \nWith the exception of the five  \" additional event \"  categories, each category could be entered individually. So you could turn up with a viper or eagle and just enter the open-unlimited station scramble, or you could make that run as a part of the combined three-event festival of racing.  \n \nYou can run each individual festival of racing event as many times as you like, with your position on the overall leaderboard always using your best times from each individual event. \n \nThe Ironbucky however can only be entered a limited number of times, within five predefined slots that between them cover the entire festival, with most slots concentrated on the opening and closing weekends. See below for more detailed instructions.  \n \n \n \n ENTRY CLASSES \n \nRace classes are Open-unlimited and Cobra Classic. \n \nEntries in Open Unlimited class may be in any type of ship, and may be engineer-modified. \n \nEntries in Cobra Classic class may be either Cobra Mk IIIs or Cobra Mk IVs, no engineer-modifications are permitted. \n \nRather than the traditional regulation class the Lonnegan brothers prefer to allow you to outfit as you wish, within the limitations of the Cobra design. However for those who prefer to stick with an regulation build, Fat Tony has reluctantly released the latest specifications of his personal Cobra Mk III  The Hotrod , available for less than 2 million with the Li Yong-Rui discount. \n \nCobras and a full range of modules for them, including everything required to copy The Hotrod are available from these local stations: \nBranglal / Skripochka Gateway (full price) 12.32LY \nTao Ti / So-yeon Port (Li Yong-Rui discount) 37.36LY \n \n Open Unlimited Class Rules \nYou may enter any ship class. If entering the Ironbucky Trophy, you have the option to enter two ships. \nEngineer mods are permitted. \nThe use of jumponium synthesis is not allowed. \nThe use of neutron star or white dwarf FSD boosting is allowed, but you may not begin a run with your FSD pre-charged from a double-charge. \nDespite the name, you may compete in open-unlimited class in any game mode (open / PG / solo). Most of the BRC race in open mode though, so playing in open gives you the best chance to bump into other racers on the course.  \n \n Cobra Classic Class Rules \nYou may enter in either a Cobra Mk III or a Cobra Mk IV \nEngineer mods, jumponium synthesis and NS / WD FSD boosting are not allowed. \n Note: For those without access to the Mk IV, it is a bigger, heavier version of the Mk III, with more internal slots and hardpoint, but the same drives. So it's inferior to the Mk III for most Buckyball activities. \n \n \n \n THE EVENTS \n \n The Station Scramble \n \n Start docked at Brash Dock in the Siren System \n Dock at each the following five stations in any order: \n Gauss Terminal [OU Geminorum] \n Harrison Terminal [LP 254-26] \n Ehrlich Terminal [Pepper] \n Vittori Terminal [LHS 1914] \n Lucid Port [HIP 28774] \n \n Return to dock at Brash Dock. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n \n The Bubble Tour \n \n Start docked at Brash Dock in the Siren System \n Dock at each the following five stations in any order: \n Winne Gateway [80 e Piscium] \n Greg's Legacy [LTT 4961]  *Asteroid Base* \n Cheranovsky City [Ngurii] \n Smeaton Port [Njikan] \n Mitzi's Den [Runo]  *Asteroid Base* \n \n Return to dock at Brash Dock. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n \n \n The Wasat Rally \n \n Start docked at Brash Dock in the Siren System \n Travel 22.32ly to the Wasat System. \n Land at either Elwood Camp or Ferguson Prospect on Wasat A 2E \n Deploy your SRV \n Drive approx 50km to the other starport. \n Request docking permission when 5-7km from your destination and drive into the hangar that your ship lands at. \n Take off \n Return to dock at Brash Dock. \n Take a look at robinjb's  Original Wasat Cup Race Thread  for more details of the route once you're down on the ground. \n \nThe entry forms allow you to submit start and finish times for your SRV section, this will use the landing screenshot at the first surface base and the screenshot when you arrive back in your ship at the second base. The original Wasat Cup Buggyball used runs from Elwood Camp to Ferguson Prospect only and AkenB's winning time was 24m30s. Since then the Elite Racers have held an event using the same Elwood to Ferguson route and Nookie Mr Smith set a course record time of 10m34s. For this event you can run the course in either direction, although Elwood Camp to Ferguson Prospect is expected to be the quicker direction anyway. \n \nSRV section times will be tracked on their own leaderboard, as there's no advantage / disadvantage to open-unlimited vs cobra classic other than possibly hangar location. During the original Wasat cup there was a bug that meant that when your SRV docked at the second base you were instantly teleported back to the first base, if this still happens don't worry about it just grab a screenshot and get flying back to Siren. \n \n \n \n THE IRONBUCKY TROPHY \n \n \n Preregister your start time!! \n Your starting screenshot time must be this time or later, and must be within 15 minutes of this time. \n Start docked at Brash Dock in the Siren System \n Complete the Station Scramble, Bubble Tour and Wasat Rally in any order, returning to dock at Brash Dock after each event. \n The clock keeps running from your starting screenshot until you dock back at Brash Dock for the third time after completing all three events. \n No repairs are permitted to either your ships or your SRV during the Ironbucky. \n You have the option to swap ships once during the Ironbucky while docked at Brash Dock, the clock continues to run while you swap ships. \n You may not make outfitting changes during the Ironbucky, so one of your ships must carry an SRV hangar. \n You may make a maximum of FIVE attempts at the Ironbucky:  \n ONE during the opening 48 hours of the Festival. \n ONE PER DAY during the final 48 hours of the Festival. \n ONE additional run made at any time during the first half of the festival (30 September - 07 October) \n ONE additional run made at any time during the last half of the festival (08 - 15 October) \n \n You may enter the Ironbucky in both open-unlimited and Cobra Classic classes if you wish, giving a maximum of 10 attempts. \n \n \n \n HOW TO ENTER \n \nPlease let us know if you intend to take part, by posting an intent to race in this thread with the following: \n \n Commander name \n Ship name(s) \n Ship type(s) \n Event(s) (Ironbucky, Station Scramble, Bubble Tour, Wasat Rally) \n Class (Cobra Classic or Open-Unlimited) \n \n Standard information on how to enter, including example screenshots, can be found on the Buckyball Racing Club website. \n \nPlease take particular note of the information above on the special requirements for Ironbucky Trophy runs. \n \nIn addition to evidence from the start, finish and waypoints, entries in Cobra Classic class must provide evidence of outfitting; either screenshots from outfitting at a starport, or (preferred if video) a view of the modules list in the right-hand cockpit panel immediately before or after the race run. Entries in Open Unlimited are not required to provide any evidence of outfitting. \n \nOptionally you may also provide the following evidence as entries in the Lonnegan Brothers' daring challenges (see below): \n \n A screenshot showing hull temperature and a visible hyperspace countdown timer, for entry into Fat Tony's Barbeque Challenge. The cockpit clock must also be visible, and the displayed time must be within a submitted complete run. \n A screenshot showing ship speed during docking, for entry into Little Nuk's Dangerous Landings Challenge. The cockpit clock must also be visible, the displayed time must be within a submitted complete run and must be no more than 30 seconds prior to a successful docking screenshot. The station interior must be visible. The station exterior must not be visible. \n If submitting video evidence for these challenges, please include an approximate time for your best speed / temperature in the notable / funny happenings section of the online entry form - or in the notes of your YouTube upload. \n \nThe race runs from 30th September to 15th October, so runs will be accepted with start times between 00:00:00 GMT on Saturday 30th September and 23:59:59 GMT on Sunday 15th October. \n \nPlease submit entries through the online entry forms (see above). \n \n \n \n ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES \n \nNot fun enough already? Okay the Lonnegan brothers are fetching back their favourite pair of challenges after their success in Glorious BAST-erds. The Lonnegan Scale of Hotness needed recalibrating after events in more recent races. \n \n Fat Tony's Barbeque Challenge: \nFat Tony loves the smell of burning meat, so he's bringing the experience to your own cockpit with his Barbeque Challenge. The winner(s) of Fat Tony's Barbeque Challenge will be the CMDRs who attain the highest hull temperature during a hyperspace countdown during a completed run. See the  \" How to Enter \"  section above. This temperature should not result in ship destruction, but Fat Tony can't really verify that unless you upload a video of the full run, so he'll take your word for it. There will be a separate challenge winner for both open-unlimited and cobra classic. \n \n Little Nuk's Dangerous Landings Challenge \nLittle Nuk on the other hand loves to see things go boom. So he's devised a cunning little challenge to encourage the occasional explosion. The Little Nuk's Dangerous Landings Challenge winner(s) will be the CMDRs who post the highest speeds inside the slot/docking bay prior to a successful landing. See the  \" How to Enter \"  section above. Again there will be a separate challenge winner for both open-unlimited and cobra classic. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n \n Fat Tony's Festival of Racing - Final

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n >   >   >  SUBMIT ENTRY HERE  <   <   < ​ \nBack in the depths of history, early humanity was restricted to the surface of a single planet, giving the visible stars a fixed apparent magnitude and position in the sky relative to each other. This led those primitive folk to group them into pictures based purely on how they appeared from the ground with the naked human eye.  Since the beginning of regular spaceflight, such an Earth-centric view has ceased to have any relevance, but this does provide an opportunity for a race to run between the main stars of one of those historic constellations. \n \nThe Lion's Back is a simple run across the major star systems of the constellation known as Leo, with a bit of variety of waypoints along the way. \n \n The Race \n \nStart at Elgin Hub in the Chertan system. \nCall, in any order, at the following waypoints: \n \n Regulus (α Leonis): pass within 200m of any resource extraction site orbiting Regulus 1 \n Denebola (β Leonis): pass within 200m of Denebola A A Belt Cluster 2 (i.e. cluster 2 of the asteroid belt around the star Denebola A) \n Algieba (γ Leonis): dock at Olivas Station \n Zosma (δ Leonis): just visit the system (since there's nothing there apart from two stars!) \n Finish back at Elgin Hub in Chertan (θ Leonis). \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nThe evidence required varies for each waypoint: \n \n For the start: screenshot on the launchpad at Elgin Hub, prior to launch, showing the station clock \n For the the waypoint at Olivas Station in Algieba, and the finish: screenshot docked at the station showing the station clock \n For the waypoint in Zosma: screenshot from the galaxy map, showing a current location of the Zosma system, plus date and time \n For the waypoints in Regulus and Denebola: screenshot in normal space (not supercruise), showing a position within 200m of the required location (resource extraction site or asteroid belt cluster), and the ship clock (see example below); it is  not  required to be stationary*. \n Alternatively, evidence may be in the form of a video of the complete run. \n \n * if you are going to go through the asteroid belt and ring at full speed, video capture is highly recommended, as at that speed it can be quite difficult to hit the screenshot button at the right time! \n \nScreenshot example for waypoint at asteroid belt cluster: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \nNote that for the waypoints in Regulus and Denebola, the requirement is to pass within 200  metres  of the nav point (you will need to drop out of supercruise to achieve this), not kilometres. \n \n Entry Classes \n \nThere are two classes available for entry: Regulation Adder and Open Unlimited. \n \nEntries in Regulation Adder class must be in an Adder outfitted as follows ( full spec on Coriolis here ): \n \n A-rated Frame Shift Drive (3A) and Power Distributor (2A) \n C-rated Thrusters (3C) \n All other core modules D-rated \n Full size (3C) fuel tank \n 3C Fuel Scoop, 2D Shield Generator, and a discovery scanner (or any other module with a mass of 2T); other optional internal slots empty (or cargo racks) \n Empty hardpoints and utility mounts. \n No engineer modifications are allowed. \n \nAdders are for sale at Elgin Hub, along with all the required modules. \n \n \nEntries in Open Unlimited class may be in any type of ship, and may be engineer-modified. \n \nFor  both  classes: FSD injection is not allowed; FSD supercharging from neutron stars or white dwarfs is not allowed. \n \n How To Enter \n \n Standard information on how to enter, including example screenshots, can be found on the Buckyball Racing Club website. \n \nPlease take particular note of the information above on the non-standard ring and asteroid belt waypoints. \n \nIn addition to evidence from the start, finish and waypoints, entries in Regulation Adder class must provide evidence of outfitting; either screenshots from outfitting at a starport, or (preferred if video) a view of the modules list in the right-hand cockpit panel immediately before or after the race run. Entries in Open Unlimited are not required to provide any evidence of outfitting. \n \nThe race runs from 2nd to 10th September, so runs will be accepted with start times between 00:00:00 GMT on Saturday 2nd September and 23:59:59 GMT on Sunday 10th September. \n \n Please submit entries through the online entry form. \n \n Final Leaderboards \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n ​ ","wordList":["submit","entry","here","back","in","the","depths","of","history","early","humanity","was","restricted","to","surface","single","planet","giving","visible","stars","fixed","apparent","magnitude","and","position","sky","relative","each","other","this","led","those","primitive","folk","group","them","into","pictures","based","purely","on","how","they","appeared","from","ground","with","naked","human","eye","since","beginning","regular","spaceflight","such","an","earth-centric","view","has","ceased","have","any","relevance","but","does","provide","opportunity","for","race","run","between","main","one","historic","constellations","lion","is","simple","across","major","star","systems","constellation","known","as","leo","bit","variety","waypoints","along","way","start","at","elgin","hub","chertan","system","call","order","following","regulus","leonis","pass","within","200m","resource","extraction","site","orbiting","denebola","belt","cluster","asteroid","around","algieba","dock","olivas","station","zosma","just","visit","there","nothing","apart","two","finish","evidence","required","varies","waypoint","screenshot","launchpad","prior","launch","showing","clock","docked","galaxy","map","current","location","plus","date","time","normal","space","not","supercruise","or","ship","see","example","below","it","be","stationary","alternatively","may","form","video","complete","if","you","are","going","go","through","ring","full","speed","capture","highly","recommended","that","can","quite","difficult","hit","button","right","spoiler","note","requirement","200","metres","nav","point","will","need","drop","out","achieve","kilometres","classes","available","regulation","adder","open","unlimited","entries","class","must","outfitted","follows","spec","coriolis","a-rated","frame","shift","drive","3a","power","distributor","2a","c-rated","thrusters","3c","all","core","modules","d-rated","size","fuel","tank","scoop","2d","shield","generator","discovery","scanner","module","mass","2t","optional","internal","slots","empty","cargo","racks","hardpoints","utility","mounts","no","engineer","modifications","allowed","adders","sale","type","engineer-modified","both","fsd","injection","supercharging","neutron","white","dwarfs","enter","standard","information","including","screenshots","found","buckyball","racing","club","website","please","take","particular","above","non-standard","addition","outfitting","either","starport","preferred","list","right-hand","cockpit","panel","immediately","before","after","runs","2nd","10th","september","so","accepted","times","00","gmt","saturday","23","59","sunday","online","final","leaderboards"]},{"name":"PRISON BRAKE","author":"AkenBosch","date":"07.08.3303","dateDate":"3303-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","infoUrl":"https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/buckyball-racing-club-presents-prison-brake-07-08-3303-13-08-3303.368703/","bannerImage":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614732620131205135/618014266678706187/prisonbrake_banner.png","extractedInfo":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n ​ FINAL LEADERBOARDS ​ \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n \nFollowing a recent surge in jailbreak attempts reported by several penal colonies both in Federation and Indipendent space, with many of those attempts actually succeeding in freeing high-profile criminals, Prison authorities of the involved systems agreed to collaborate on a joint effort to test, revise and improve their penal colonies' security and containment systems. Several in-depth analysis and simulations underlined a potential weakness in the response time of the automated Incoming Traffic Profiler and Threat Assessment Network, highlighting the possibility for a skilled pilot to bring a ship fast enough inside the security perimeters, sabotage prison structures or pick up escapees and flee before the prison defenses even had a chance to react. Even the most accurate simulations can't compare with live testing on the field though, so the need has arisen to find a way to repeatedly stress the automated systems with live incoming ships traffic. Of course finding someone crazy enough to be willing to risk a bounty, and potentially lose ships on expensive rebuys just for the sake of science is no easy task, therefore Prison authorities had the difficult mission of finding the craziest pilots for the craziest job. \n \n \nAfter some harsh negotiations with Prison authorities involving the written permission to host a public race, a disclaimer on any potential damage inflicted to Prison authority structures and an open bar tab at  \" The Tipsy Damsel \"  in Kelleam Ring, the Buckyball Racing Club is proud to present...Prison Brake! \n \n \n \n New to racing? Want to know what the Club is all about? Go take a look at the  Buckyball Racing Club official site  (courtesy of cmdr Drakhyr), you'll find a recap of all previous races, general instructions on how to participate to the races and some very useful instructional videos explaining the basics (and even a bit more) of racing flight. And if after seeing those you think you aren't fit for racing, scroll down a bit and take a look at the several blooper reels and funny videos provided. Whatever your skills are, trust me, you are fit! \n This race requires the Horizons expansion. \n   \nTHE RULES \n \n \nThe race will require participants to start from Kelleam Ring in the Slink's Eye system and visit the Bailey Penal Colony in the Ekhi sytem, the Hume Penal Colony in the Atagat system and the Barcelo Penal Colony in Epsilon Indi, before returning to the start/finish line at Kelleam Ring. The three colonies can be visited in any order of choice, at each settlement participants will have to make a full landing on the colony's landing pad and depart as quickly as possible. Beware of the settlements security perimeters, once you get past them and the trespassing alert shows up, you'll have around 25 seconds before getting fined, once this happens you'll have an additional 15 seconds to leave the area before the fine turns into a bounty, and you'd better leave in a hurry because you'll either have to run away very fast or face a rebuy screen! \n \n Important note : even though the three installations have a landing pad, being secured penal colonies they have no docking facility, therefore it's not possible to open communication and ask docking permission. Landings have to be eyeballed and will behave as a standard planetary surface landing. \n \nRuns can be made in any game mode (open, solo or private group). \n \nThe race runs from  Monday August 7th 3303 at 00:00:00  to  Sunday August 13th at 23:59:59 . All times are  server time , entries ending after the deadline are still valid as long as they started before it. \nCommanders willing to participate may declare their intent at any moment during the entire duration of the event. \n \nTo get a better grasp of what the race requires you to do, how to do it and what places you'll have to visit, please take a look at this very well put together and commented introductory video about the Prison Brake race, courtesy of artigan99/Cmdr Codger: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t [video=youtube;YdtRNTVVSZE]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdtRNTVVSZE[/video] \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n SHIP CLASSES \n \nThe race can be run in two different classes of ships: \n \n-  Eagle Regular : fly the good ol' Eagle Mk II in stock racing attire, a classic for every respectable Buckyballer! To be eligible for the regulation class, the ship must be outfitted exactly as follows:  https://coriolis.edcd.io/outfit/eagle?code=A0p2t5F5l3d5s8f2----2u3u---.Iw18kA==.Aw18kA==..IwegLCoAziMKYEMDmAbeIAKAnAlgZwHsA7AAgCFtEBrDYKBoA=== & bn=Prison Brake \nSolo Orbiter in the nearby Altair system (34.32 ly from Slink's Eye) has a shipyard selling it, and is usually good on stock with all the required modules for outfitting as requested. \n \n \n-  Open Unlimited : bring your speed monsters into the fray! From the puny Sidewinder to the imposing Corvette, anything goes. Engineering and synthesis are allowed.  \n \n \n STEP BY STEP COURSE INSTRUCTIONS \n \n \n \n  Starting at Kelleam Ring, take a screenshot before launching with the clock visible, this will count as the start time of your entry. If you are running for the Eagle Regular class, a screenshot of your module panel showing the ship outfitting is also mandatory. \n  Fly to your first penal colony of choice. \n  Once there, touch down on the colony landing pad bringing the ship to a full stop. \n  Take a screenshot of the landed ship with the hud clock visible. You may take the screenshot even while already spooling up the engines, it's just needed as confirmation of a complete landing. \n  Take off as fast as you can (remember, better not be there 40 seconds after trespassing!) and head to your next waypoint. \n  Repeat the same for the second and third colony of your selected route. \n  Once you have landed at all three penal colonies and taken a landed screenshot each, return to Kelleam Ring. \n  Take a final screenshot as soon as you touch down with the station clock visible, this will count as the finish time of your entry. \n  Enjoy a strong one and some moments of relax at The Tipsy Damsel. And remember,  don't drink and fly . \n \n \n ADDITIONAL NOTES \n \n- The Slink's Eye system orbits a white dwarf, this means that it is possible to fly inside its jet cones to obtain a one-time boost to FSD range. Use this at your discretion. \n \n- Whatch out for your fuel management, once you launch from Kelleam Ring you won't meet a refueling facility until you get back there at the end of your run, unless you opt to take a lenghty detour to some nearby station (this is allowed, by the way). The Eagle Regular comes equipped with a fuel scoop, don't forget to use it!  \n \n- Even though it never happened in my many (many, many, many) tries, should you happen to find the landing pad blocked by a security ship I'll also accept a full landing in the general vicinity of the penal colony, the important things being inside the trespassing perimeter, and having the settlement or at least identifiable parts of it in view. Mind you, those pads are rather large so if you are in a small ship you may as well land beside the blocking ship without much problems. \n \n- On the subject of fines and bounties: from my testing, being wanted in a system doesn't affect the type of response or the response time of the penal colony there, so should you happen to have a bounty on your head because of previous attempts, you can continue with your subsequent runs with no problem whatsoever. If you are taken to the rebuy screen (for one reason or another) all your bounties will become  \" dormant \" ; if you gain a fine in the system you have a dormant bounty for, the bounty will be reactivated and you'll be wanted again. The only way to get rid of a dormant bounty is to wait for its expiring time, after which it will be transformed in a simple fine that can be paid at any station of the involved system, or anywhere in the galaxy where Interstellar Factors are present, usually systems with low security. The nearest Interstellar Factors contact I could find in the vicinity of the race course and suited for large ships docking is located at Hernon Dock in the Tjurinas system, 30.83 ly from Slink's Eye. \n \n- Barcelo Penal Colony is the only settlement on the surface of the (in)famous Mitterand Hollow moon orbiting New Africa, in the Epsilon Indi system. If you are an experienced commander of the Pilots Federation, I'm pretty sure you are aware of what this implies. If you are new to the Elite universe, or never happened to cross this peculiar corner of the galaxy...good luck and have fun! \n \n \n OK, I WANT TO RACE! HOW DO I ENTER? \n \nDeclare your intent to race in this thread by providing the following informations: \n- Cmdr name \n- Forum username (if different from cmdr name) \n- Race class  \n- Ship name \n- Ship type \n \nWhen you have completed your run, click on the SUBMIT TIME button right below here or under the banner at the top and enter all the required information, together with a link to your screenshots or video evidence.

\n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t “Well, I guess it's out of our hands, now.”  Lt. Commander Friedrich Rinz declared, activating the docking computer. \n     A burst of thrust from the engines pushed both him and his gunner, Lt. Amy Spinner, back into their seats as the Lakon Type 9 Heavy Transporter,  Make a Splash , made a close pass by the Coriolis starport  Viete Colony . The central trade hub of the Koine system, its inhabitants operated a refinery economy, taking minerals mined within the system or elsewhere and turning them into metals and materials suitable for manufacturing into a million different commodities. They depended upon regular shipments from the surrounding systems for provisions, medical supplies and high-tech goods and the arrival of a heavy transporter was a cause for celebration.  Viete Colony  was just an ordinary home amongst the stars for the tens of thousands of people living on board her but to those new to the system, or unwary, she had a big surprise in store. \n      Viete Colony  was armed. \n     High-gravity industrial processing and refining units were suspended on sturdy arms four kilometres long, sprouting from the central cuboctahedral body of the Coriolis. Almost one hundred metres thick and designed to withstand the inertial forces of the station's rotation, they could smash a ship into pieces like a giant mace. \n     “ Viete Colony  to Lakon Romeo India November Heavy: disengage your docking computer and approach on manual. Beware the station arms. Repeat: disengage your docking computer.” \n     “Arms? What arms?” \n     The radio signal cut off leaving only the sound of static, as five hundred cargo canisters and associated debris suddenly cluttered the scanner display at flight operations. \n \n “Listen, people, that's the third heavy transport to be destroyed this month. We need ideas on how to stop this. Put your thoughts out there. Anything actionable. We have to protect our posteriors on this one, as it's always admin and traffic control that gets it from the president when he has to cough up the insurance on the shipment.” \n     The head of the Imperial Flight Operations Bureau on board  Viete Colony  was Fred Decker and it had been his eardrums that had faced the assault of the company president who had paid for the delivery of the cargo carried by the Make a Splash. Her shipment of high-tech goods, imported from the nearby technology hub of Gandza, had been worth millions of credits and was now mostly adorning the exterior surfaces of the station. It had been made clear to him by the president that his job was now on the line, so he had set up a hasty staff meeting to come up with a plan, before there were any more casualties and he was demoted to latrine technician. \n     “We could disable docking computer support and require all ships to land manually.” Jayne Doyle, one of the assistant traffic controllers, suggested to groans all around the tiny conference room. This had been suggested before and was readily met with the usual argument: \n     “No good. We need approval from the Elite Federation of Pilots administrators to remove that support. You've more chance of getting the Federation to allow civilian ships to dock with a Farragut. And many pilots of large ships depend on the docking computer. Half the Belugas coming here wouldn't be able to land and then how would everyone commute?” \n     There was a moment's silence as Fred Decker's reply sank in. It was no good relying upon outside help. There had to be something they could do themselves. \n     “Can we make the high-gravity units more noticeable? Paint them luminous colours and increase the lighting, perhaps?” \n     This was another common idea, with flaws, from another assistant traffic controller, Angus Ring. Fred Decker gave the standard reply, hoping that some original thoughts would soon find their way into the stuffy room through the underpowered air-conditioning system. \n     “It's the docking computer that needs to be made aware of the danger. Pilot awareness doesn't make any difference once that AI has been engaged. It can be lit up and glowing green like a Christmas tree on Achenar but if the human pilot isn't at the controls to see it, then it's pointless.” \n Again there was silence and Fred Decker let it persist to give everyone a chance to think. After several minutes it became uncomfortable and he broke the silence. \n     “Come on: there has to be one idea coming from this meeting! Let's hear it, no matter how crazy or unpopular you think it might be. Action will not be taken against you for suggesting something absurd.” \n     There was silence again and Fred Decker looked over to his Chief Traffic Controller, Orla Fell, who had been conspicuous because of her silence. With fifteen years of experience, she was the only person there besides himself who knew how to get a Panther Clipper through the airlock without denting the station and he had been hoping that she would have something to say. \n     Orla saw him looking at her but she had wanted to wait until her idea was the last possible course of action before suggesting it. She had also taken the liberty of recording the meeting, so as to get the 'Action will not be taken against you' part down safely. Her career depended upon it. \n     “It is fundamentally an awareness issue that we face here. If pilots coming here all knew of the danger posed by the high-g units, then they would be careful to make a manual approach and not engage their docking computer until on the safe side of the station. The challenge is to raise awareness on a scale such that pilots from all over civilised space – and the Federation and the Alliance as well – know that  Viete Colony  has this hazard.” \n     “We have an advertising budget that allows us to run a few hoardings for Achilles and Gutamaya outside the station entrance – on solar power. That kind of campaign would need tens – no, hundreds – of millions of credits. And it would be forgotten in a week or two.” \n Fred Decker had been hopeful of a better suggestion but Orla was not finished. \n     “The way to get large-scale attention is not through an advertising campaign but through an event that people will remember for a long time.” \n     “More memorable than a T-9 and five hundred tons of smartwatches being blown up?” \n     “T-9s get blown up ten times a day in some stations and Galnet doesn't touch that story. No, we need an event that attracts the attention of the Elite Federation of Pilots and it must be something that does not cost us anything to stage ourselves.” \n     There was laughter from around the room. An event that would attract the attention of the entire galaxy – for free! Orla must have got hold of some of her favourite Eranin Pearl Whisky...  \n     “We're all ears, Orla.”  Fred Decker smiled, though inwardly he was cringing and regretting what he had said about absurd suggestions. \n     “Well, my great uncle on my mother's side has a nephew who is Chief Traffic Controller at  Bushkov Dock  in the Borovii system, just over thirty light-years away from here. That station is also a Coriolis with high-g processing units and they also have occasional mishaps. So what about a race between the two stations?” \n     “A race? Who would race just from here to there because you suggest it – and who in the galaxy would care about it and pay attention if they did?” \n     “The Buckyball Racing Club.” \n\t\t \n\t \n Premise \n ​ This is a short course race for any ship, starting at  Viete Colony  in the Koine system and calling at  Tesla Dock  in Gandza and then  Crick Orbital  in Osermians before finishing at  Bushkov Dock  in Borovii, or in the reverse order, starting at  Bushkov Dock  and ending at  Viete Colony . Both  Viete Colony  and  Bushkov Dock  are variants of the Coriolis station with long 'arms' extending approximately 4km away from the central body of the station, which is what gives the race its name. These stations can sometimes surprise unwary pilots (and possibly docking computers, although I have not tested it) that exit supercruise on the far side of the station to the airlock, or who set a course for their next destination when it is behind the station, giving them nicknames such as 'noob hammers of doom' or 'doom hammers'. This race therefore tests both supercruise approach skills (admittedly now much easier since you can see the station's orientation in supercruise) and flying in normal space as well as docking manoeuvres. \n. \nAn inexpensive stock Adder option, the Adder Special class, is available to provide a level playing field for comparison with other racers, with a fixed load-out and no use of engineering or synthesis, whilst in Unlimited class anything goes: all ships, engineering and synthesis are allowed. The Adder can be purchased and outfitted to the race specification at either  Viete Colony  or  Bushkov Dock . \n. \nThe race can be run in any game mode but Open play is encouraged so as to see and meet other racers on the course. Racers from all platforms are welcome! The Horizons expansion is not required for this race. \n \n Entering the Race \n ​ In order to enter this race, screenshot or video evidence will be required as detailed below. Please upload to a site such as imgur or YouTube and PM me a link through these forums. It is not essential to announce your intent to race in this thread but it will be helpful to let myself and the other racers know to look out for you on the course! The race can be run in any mode – there is no need to say which was used when submitting. It is not expected that running in a particular mode will give an advantage in instance loading times. \n. \nYour PM will need to include the following information: \n \n \n Forum name \n CMDR name \n Race class (Adder Special or Unlimited) \n Ship type \n Ship name \n Race time \n Link to screenshots or video \n \nIn addition to these, the leaderboards for both Unlimited and Adder Special classes will also show in which direction you ran the course: starting at V iete Colony  and finishing at  Bushkov Dock  or the other way around. In Unlimited, your fastest time for each ship type will appear on the leaderboard, regardless of which direction you ran the course in. \n. \nThe screenshots or video should show the following: \n \n \n The station clock with time and date on the pad at your chosen starting station (  Viete Colony , Koine, or  Bushkov Dock , Borovii ). \n The station clock upon landing at either  Tesla Dock , Gandza, or  Crick Orbital , Osermians. \n The station clock upon landing at either  Crick Orbital , Osermians, or  Tesla Dock , Gandza. \n The station clock upon finishing at either  Bushkov Dock  or  Viete Colony . \n Your right-hand panel showing the modules equipped (Adder Special class only). \n \nAdditional information on how to outfit your ship and collect evidence for race submissions can be found at the Buckyball Racing Club's webite:  http://www.buckyballracing.org.uk \n \n Ship Specifications \n ​ The Adder Special race class requires an Adder with a particular load-out. The Adder and all modules required can be purchased from either  Viete Colony  or  Bushkov Dock . \n \n \n Thrusters : 3D \n FSD : 3D \n Life Support : 1D \n Power Distributor : 2D \n Power Plant : 3D \n Sensors : 3E \n Shield Generator : 3E \n \nNo other modules should be equipped (including discovery scanners and a fuel scoop!). \ncost:  118,720 Cr \nYou should have a jump range of  13.71 LY  and all modules should fit into one screen on your right-hand panel. This Adder can make it around the course without refuelling, so don't worry about not having a fuel scoop. \n. \nIn Unlimited class, all ship types, engineering and synthesis are allowed. This is to allow as many ship types as possible the chance to be competitive on the course. Every type of ship in the game should be able to make each leg in a single jump with adequate engineering and/or FSD boosting. The distances for each leg are as follows: \n \n \n Koine to Gandza:  26.94LY \n Gandza to Osermians:  20.74LY \n Osermians to Borovii:  19.02LY \n \nThe Adder Special can complete this course in seven jumps. \n \n Notes and Trivia \n ​ Koine is a Powerplay 'Control System', held by Arissa Lavigny-Duval at the time of writing. The ruling faction is the 9th Legion, a Player Minor Faction, but this is not their home system. Traffic in Open may be increased near the end of the Powerplay cycle on Wednesdays. As long as you are not carrying any Powerplay cargo, Powerplay NPCs should not bother you regardless of whether you are pledged to a Power, however other players might react differently. If you want to avoid the potential hazards this might entail, you can run the race in either a private group or solo mode. \n. \nElite Dangerous: Premonition spoiler (although anyone who was playing on the 29th April knows about it already) \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Salomé, the protagonist of the official Elite: Dangerous novels Elite: Reclamation and Elite Dangerous: Premonition, was killed in the Anumclaw system on 29th April 3303, located roughly half way between Koine and Borovii – plotting a course in economical mode from Borovii to Koine will take you through the system. \n\t\t \n\t \n There is also a  Viete Colony  in Salomé's home system of Prism, although that is an outpost rather than a Coriolis. \n \n \n*** \n Final Leaderboards \n*** \n

Most video cards have software that will enable video capture without excessive performance impact, for example,  Plays.tv  for AMD,  Shadowplay  for Nvidia, and  Game DVR  for Xbox. \n \nScreenshots are the fastest and lowest bandwidth way to submit your run, but if you wish to upload a full video and link to that instead, that would be great! \nIf you’re feeling kind, please provide timestamps for the start and end screenshot times. \n  \nFor the Regulation Hauler, you'll need 6 screenshots. \n1.

I recommend  imgur  or  youtube .  Submit your run using  this form .   \n \n Intent Is it customary (but not required) for Buckyballers to declare their intent to race before doing so, in something like the following format. \n \n Intent to Race \n CMDR Name (forum alias) \n Ship name  (ship type) \nRace Class \n  \nExample: \n Intent to Moon the Lighthouse \n CMDR Bruski \n Sugar Glider  (Asp X) \nOpen Unlimited \n \n \n FAQ Have any questions?  Please post them in this thread and I'll answer as soon as possible! \n \nQ: Is stacking double jumps acceptable if the arms line up? \nA: Yes, the more dangerous option is always encouraged! \n \nQ: Is mooning the Lighthouse advisable? \nA: It's a lawless system, what can I say? \n \nQ: Can I submit runs from multiple CMDRs? \nA: If you have them, yes, feel free! \n \nQ: Can I submit runs for multiple ship types in the Open Unlimited Class? \nA: Yes, variety is encouraged!  Only the fastest ship will count for placement, though honorable mention will be given to the fastest ship of each size category. \n \nQ: Can I begin the race with a supercharged FSD?  (from using the double charge technique above) \nA: Yes!  The name of the race is DOUBLE Action Jackson after all.

It will work as follows: \n \n- Come along to our stand in the LAN room. It will be the one flying these flags. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n - Speak to one of the  \" race marshals \"  (that will be either myself, Cmdr furrycat, Cmdr Samwell Drakhyr or anyone else you see wearing one of the official Buckyball race marshal gilet's bearing our logo). \n \n- You'll be taken through the flight controls (we hope to have a Thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS X, a Warthog HOTAS with pedals, a PC XBOX controller and a good old fashioned keyboard and mouse - you can pick your favourite) and have the course explained to you (it basically involves flying to and landing at three other stations including the finish line). \n \n- You'll be able to re-bind the controls to your personal preferences (or indeed, if you want to bring along your own control binding files for any of those control mechanisms on a USB stick then we'd be happy to install them for you). \n \n- You'll be given a short practice flight which should take around 5 minutes (involving one hyperspace jump, a supercruise to the starting station and a landing) in order to get used to the controls. Then you'll line up on the starting launch pad ready to boogie. \n \n- When the attending race marshal says  \" go \"  you'll launch, fly to each of the other stations that make up the course, land, launch and continue on to the next. \n \n- When you land at the final station your time will be recorded and your race entry will be added to our special scoreboard. We expect runs to take between 10 and 15 minutes. \n \nAt the end of the weekend (hopefully during the 6pm closing event in the main room on Sunday) we'll announce the winners. The person with the fastest time will receive a Viper ship kit (or other Frontier store game extra of equivalent value if they already one). The two runners up will each receive a flight suit pack of their choice. All entrants will receive a  \" rare \"  Buckyball Beer Mat (until we run out). \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \nRace course is as follows: \n \n Start: Renenbellot Market, Woloniugo  \n Stop 1: Cady City: No Chianga  \n Stop 2: Cartan Station, K'uanele  \n Finish: Haignere Ring, LTT 12294  \n Viper outfitting as follows: \n \n Alloys: Lightweight  \n Powerplant: 2A  \n Thrusters: 3A  \n FSD: 3A  \n Life support: 2D  \n Power distributor: 3A  \n Sensors: 3D  \n Fuel tank: 2C  \n Shields: 2D  \n No other optional internals, utility mounts or hardpoints fitted. \n \nClick here for Coriolis outfitting link:  Lavecon Buckyball Racer \n \n \nFAQ \n \nQ) Do I need to book in advance? \nA) Nope, just come along to the stand. If we're busy you can either wait or arrange a time with the attending race marshal so you can come back later. \n \nQ) Can I run more than once? \nA) Yes, absolutely. A big part of Buckyball Racing is about trying to beat your own previous best time. If there are people waiting then racers who haven't yet had a go will be given priority but otherwise you're encouraged to come back and try as many times as you like (within reason I guess). \n \nQ) Can I race in any ship? \nA) Nope, you'll be racing in a race prepped Viper Mk III (this is the ship that appears on our logo). \n \nQ) Will I need to use my own account? \nA) Nope, we have a  \" Buckyball Racer \"  account that you will be using, hopefully with enough funds to cover the rebuys (see also,  \" Can I drink and fly \"  and  \" What happens if I blow up \" ). \n \nQ) Can I drink and fly. \nA) Absolutely, although possibly not at the same time (see also,  \" What happens if I blow up \" ) \n \nQ) What happens if I blow up? \nA) That will be the end of your run and we will point and laugh. If nobody else appears to be waiting then you can just try again, otherwise you'll have to go to the back of the queue. \n \nQ) What happens if we crash so many ships that the Buckyball Racer account runs out of money? \nA) Errr ... at the time of writing we haven't planned for this eventuality. \n \nQ) Aren't those the same crummy beer mats you were handing out to anyone that would take one at last year's Lavecon? \nA) Yes, but now they're  \" rare \" ! \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Q) I'm unable to attend Lavecon, can I still take part? \nA) The official race course and Viper Mk III loadout can be found above. If you want to try the race for yourself then that's fine. Feel free to post your time in this forum thread. It won't appear on the official scoreboard and it won't qualify for any prizes but you will at least have the pride (or shame) of knowing how your skills compare to those of the average p%ssed up Lavecon attendee who's unfamiliar with the controls and has the added pressure of a gilet wearing Buckyball race marshal standing over them with a stop watch. I'll also endeavour to post photos of the official scoreboard from time to time throughout the course of the weekend so you can spectate from afar. \n \nThat's it! If you have any further questions please feel free to post them in this thread and I'll add them to the FAQ. \n \nFly fast commanders. \n \no7 ","wordList":["as","stated","in","the","above","flyer","which","will","be","available","printed","form","on","front","desk","buckyball","racing","club","are","hosting","race","lan","room","at","this","year","lavecon","event","entitled","somewhat","unimaginatively","2017","is","open","to","anyone","attending","who","fancies","go","and","running","throughout","weekend","it","timed","much","style","of","star","reasonably","priced","car","feature","from","bbc","tv","show","top","gear","work","follows","come","along","our","stand","one","flying","these","flags","spoiler","speak","marshals","that","either","myself","cmdr","furrycat","samwell","drakhyr","or","else","you","see","wearing","official","marshal","gilet","bearing","logo","ll","taken","through","flight","controls","we","hope","have","thrustmaster","t-flight","hotas","warthog","with","pedals","pc","xbox","controller","good","old","fashioned","keyboard","mouse","can","pick","your","favourite","course","explained","basically","involves","landing","three","other","stations","including","finish","line","able","re-bind","personal","preferences","indeed","if","want","bring","own","control","binding","files","for","any","those","mechanisms","usb","stick","then","happy","install","them","given","short","practice","should","take","around","minutes","involving","hyperspace","jump","supercruise","starting","station","order","get","used","up","launch","pad","ready","boogie","when","says","fly","each","make","land","continue","next","final","time","recorded","entry","added","special","scoreboard","expect","runs","between","10","15","end","hopefully","during","6pm","closing","main","sunday","announce","winners","person","fastest","receive","viper","ship","kit","frontier","store","game","extra","equivalent","value","they","already","two","runners","suit","pack","their","choice","all","entrants","rare","beer","mat","until","run","out","start","renenbellot","market","woloniugo","stop","cady","city","no","chianga","cartan","uanele","haignere","ring","ltt","12294","outfitting","alloys","lightweight","powerplant","2a","thrusters","3a","fsd","life","support","2d","power","distributor","sensors","3d","fuel","tank","2c","shields","optional","internals","utility","mounts","hardpoints","fitted","click","here","coriolis","link","racer","faq","do","need","book","advance","nope","just","re","busy","wait","arrange","so","back","later","more","than","once","yes","absolutely","big","part","about","trying","beat","previous","best","there","people","waiting","racers","haven","yet","had","priority","but","otherwise","encouraged","try","many","times","like","within","reason","guess","prepped","mk","iii","appears","use","my","account","using","enough","funds","cover","rebuys","also","drink","what","happens","blow","although","possibly","not","same","point","laugh","nobody","again","queue","crash","ships","money","errr","writing","planned","eventuality","aren","crummy","mats","were","handing","would","last","now","unable","attend","still","loadout","found","yourself","fine","feel","free","post","forum","thread","won","appear","qualify","prizes","least","pride","shame","knowing","how","skills","compare","average","ssed","attendee","unfamiliar","has","pressure","standing","over","watch","endeavour","photos","spectate","afar","further","questions","please","add","fast","commanders","o7"]},{"name":"NEBULOCITY","author":"Jhyrryl","date":"03.06.3303","dateDate":"3303-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","infoUrl":"https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-brc-presents-a-race-for-long-range-ships-nebulocity-3-11-june-3303.353261/","bannerImage":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614732620131205135/618013079883743232/nebulocity_banner2.png","extractedInfo":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n > = > = > = >   SUBMIT ENTRY   < = < = < = < ​ \n WELCOME! \n Especially to any newcomers to Buckyball Racing who may have come here from Newsletter #177.  Thanks for the shoutout, Frontier! \n \n OBJECTIVE \n Starting at Rebuy Prospect in the Fullerene C60 system, visit the stations and tourist beacons specified below, making sure to take in the views of four nearby nebulas! \n \n LEADERBOARDS \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t DESCRIPTION \n In recent years racers have seen significant improvements made to their vehicles, and humanity has been pushing the boundaries of the Bubble farther and farther, some organizations even establishing stations in the deepest regions of space.  In celebration of all that human progress the Buckyball Racing Club is hosting  Nebulocity .   Nebulocity  starts at the newly constructed Rebuy Station in the Fullerene C60 system, and takes racers on a whirlwind tour of four nearby nebulas, some familiar and others less so. \n  \n EVENTS, DIVISIONS, and CLASSES \n EVENTS \n Nebulocity  is comprised of two events in order to make the race accessible to newer racers and those with restricted financial situations, an Intro event and a Main event. \n \nBoth events start at Rebuy Prospect in the Fullerene C60 system and end at Ring Mine in the 2MASS J03291977+3124572 system, but have different stops along the way.  Events can be run in reverse (starting at Ring Mine and ending at Rebuy Prospect) allowing pilots two opportunities per round trip to get their best time.  (note: The race organizer understands that reversed courses are not always balanced against their forward direction, and is okay with that.) \n \n DIVISIONS \nThe main event has multiple divisions, dictating what ship type(s) can be raced in that event.  Each event division will have its own leaderboards. \n \n CLASSES \nPilots choose to race in either the Standard or Unlimited class for both events.  The Standard class is prohibited from utilizing Horizons-only benefits; but anything goes in the Unlimited class.  This is a one-time choice made when you submit your first run.  All further submissions in both events must abide by that choice.  Note that this results in two leaderboards for each event/division.  Both events have two or three additional waypoints for those racing in the Unlimited class. \n \n EVENT DESCRIPTIONS \n In these descriptions links will be provided to example builds, but you are free to choose and build out ships however you prefer, so long as they follow all requirements for Class and Division.  For information on how to collect race evidence at tourist beacons, see the Submitting Entries section below. \n \n EVENT 1  --  Route Six-66 \n Intro Event \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t This is the easiest event to race in, and the least expensive for which to acquire a ship.  It bypasses the larger, more well-known nebula that can be seen from Human space, and instead focuses on three smaller ones. \n \n Divisions \nThis event only has one division:  Hauler . \n \n Route \n \n Start at  Rebuy Prospect  in the  Fullerene C60  system. \n Race to the  HIP 16813  system. \n Dock at  Sisters' Refuge  (planetary ring asteroid). \n Race to the  T Tauri  system. \n Dock at  Hind Mine  (planetary ring asteroid). \n If racing in the Unlimited class: \n Collect Evidence at the  Hind Nebula View  planetary tourist beacon. \n \n Race to the  BD+30 623  system. (666 LYs from Fullerene C60) \n Collect media evidence at the  Little Blue  tourist beacon. \n If racing in the Unlimited class: \n Race to the  HIP 18077  system. \n Dock at  Mahon Research Base  (planetary base). \n \n Race to the  2MASS J03291977+3124572  system. \n Dock at  Ring Mine  (planetary ring asteroid). \n \n\t\t \n\t \n EVENT 2  --  California Dreamin' \n Main Event \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t This event takes racers to a wide variety of asteroid bases and tourism beacons in deep-space, all situated in or around five nebulas in the rough direction of the California Nebula. \n \n Divisions \nAny ship can be raced in this event, but they will be separated by size. \n \n Small \n Medium \n Large \n \n Route \n \n Start at  Rebuy Prospect  in the  Fullerene C60  system. \n Race to the  HIP 16813  system. \n Dock at  Sisters' Refuge  (planetary ring asteroid) \n Race to the  Pleione  system. \n Dock at  Stargazer  (asteroid belt asteroid). \n Race to the  T Tauri  system. \n Dock at  Hind Mine  (planetary ring asteroid). \n If racing in the Unlimited class: \n Collect evidence at the  Hind Nebula View  planetary tourist beacon. \n \n Race to the  BD+30 623  system. \n Collect media evidence at the  Little Blue  tourist beacon. \n If racing in the Unlimited class: \n Race to the  HIP 18077  system. \n Dock at  Mahon Research Base  (planetary base). \n \n Race to the  California Sector BA-A E6  system. \n Collect media evidence at the  Alliance Outpost in the California Nebula  tourist beacon. \n If racing in the Unlimited class: \n Collect media evidence at the  Mic Turner Bark Mounds  planetary tourist beacon. \n \n Race to the  California Sector BV-Y C7  system. \n Dock at  Darwin Research Facility  (solitary, stellar asteroid). \n Race to the  2MASS J03291977+3124572  system. \n Dock at  Ring Mine  (planetary ring asteroid). \n \n\t\t \n\t \n SUBMITTING ENTRIES \n For this race, you will  submit a Google form  rather than send email. \n \nBefore racing, please review the Buckyball Racing Club's  \" How to Enter \"  article  for info on how to collect evidence. \n \n TOURIST BEACONS \nThis race features the use of Tourist Beacons as waypoints.  To collect evidence at these locations you must be within  75 100 meters of the beacon, have it selected, and your ship must be stationary (i.e., shows a speed of 0).  For example: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n DECLARING INTENT TO RACE \n Before racing, it is customary to declare your intent to race by posting in the thread, but it is not strictly necessary.  To declare your intent, specify the following: CMDR Name (forum alias) \nStandard/Unlimited Class \nIntro Event \n Hauler Ship Name \nMain Event - [Division] \n Other Ship Name ​ \nSo my intent to race might look like: \nCMDR Jak (Jhyrryl) \nUnlimited Class \nIntro Event \n Mini Enigma \nMain Event - Small (Unlimited) \n Enigma Limo  (Dolphin) ​ \n BEAUTY SHOTS AND HOLO-ME \n If you are in 1st-place on any leaderboard the podium requires both a beauty shot of your ship, and a capture of your Holo-Me avatar. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t How-To Beauty Shot \n \n drop out of supercruise next to a class F star in Solo; \n orient the ship so that the star fills the upper-left screen; \n open the camera suite (CTRL+ALT+SPACE by default); \n switch to the SHIP FRONT camera and hide the UI (RSHIFT+/ by default) \n take a screenshot (F10); \n \nHow-To Holo-Me \n \n Open Holo-Me from Station Services \n switch to the HEAD tab; \n take a screenshot; \n \n\t\t \n\t \n Upload both screenshots to imgur.com or other appropriate hosting service, then include links to them with your submission. \n \n FAQ \n Q:   What are the dates, again? \n A:  The race started on the 3rd of June, 3303 and ends on the 18th of June, 3303. \n \n Q:   How close to tourist beacons do I need be in order for it to count? \n A:   100 meters.   Previously it had been 75 meters, but then someone demonstrated that an Anaconda needs more room.  Prior to that it had been 50 meters! \n \n Q:   In systems with 2+ destinations, can I visit them in any order or only that provided in the event description? \n A:  For systems with multiple destinations, you can visit those destinations in any order. \n \n Q:   Even when running in reverse? \n A:  Especially when running in reverse. \n \n Q:   How many ships can I race? \n A:  4, but all must be in the same Class (i.e., either Standard or Unlimited). \n \n Q:   So I can race in all three divisions of California Dreamin' and a Hauler in Route Six-66? \n A:  Yes. \n \n Q:   Can I race a Hauler for the small ships division of California Dreamin'? \n A:  Yes.  Do you think that's a winning strategy? \n \n Q:   Do you think I want to win? \n A:  This is the perfect race for people who like to visit new places more than winning.

Aquarii system, around which the main movie plot revolves. \nTo allow contestants to reenact the actions at Cooper Arena as depicted in the main movie sequence, where the protagonist's ragtag team of theft professionals is involved in a hazardous SRV mission to the settlement in order to sabotage its state of the art defence system and steal an extremely valuable data package, the real Cooper Arena director of operations Ben Nyhill has agreed to provide a prop data beacon for runners to simulate the package  \" stealing \" , also while keeping it disconnected from the defence grid that's actually operating in live fire mode for ongoing real-world settlement operations. Nyhill has also stressed the fact that due to the sentry turrets mainframe's security hardcoding, while he can guarantee the safety of everyone involved in operations around the prop data beacon, Cooper Arena Administration Board won't be held responsible for any damage incurred by participants from improper or aggressive actions carried out in close proximity to the turrets perimeter. \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n  \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n ​ \n \nRULES AT A GLANCE \n \nThe race can be run in two different classes: a regulation  \" Adder Fodder \"  class (recalling the exact same type of ship and build used by main characters in the movie), and an Open Unlimited class where every type of ship in any configuration is welcome. Engineered modules, enhanced performance thrusters and FSD injection are  NOT  allowed in this race. Sorry ship-tuning folks!  \nOf course, participants can have runs in both classes. Open Unlimited attempts in multiple ships are allowed, though only the best entry will show on the boards at any one time, with the notable exception of the Beluga liner. Pilots who will risk their luxury cruisers on the course may have two entries on the leaderboard, one for the Beluga and another for any other better run done in a different ship. \n \n \n  Start from London Relay in Epsilon Indi \n  Fly to Bridger Town in Chi Herculis, land there and depart \n  Reach Cooper Arena in 241 G. Aquarii \n  Land at least 8 km away from the settlement. Any point is valid, as long as its distance from Cooper is no less than 8 km. \n  Reach the settlement by SRV and scan the data point there. \n  Put at least 5 km between you and the settlement, then recall your ship for departure \n  Land again at London Relay in Epsilon Indi \n  Simple as that! \n \nRepairing and refueling of the ship during the run is  NOT  allowed, participants will have to plan ahead their scoopings and manage their hulls and modules integrity accordingly (more on this below). Repair of the SRV by synthesis  IS allowed . \n \n \nThe race runs from  Saturday May 6th 3303 at 00:00:00  to  Friday May 19th at 05:59:59 AM . All times are  server time , entries ending after the deadline are still valid as long as they started before it. \n \n \n RULES IN DETAIL \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t SHIP CLASSES \n \n-  Adder Fodder : test your flying prowess at the pilot chair of an Adder  (surprise, suprise!) . To be eligible for the regulation class, the ship must be outfitted exactly as follows:  - link to Coriolis - \nSolo Orbiter in the nearby Altair system has a shipyard selling them, and is usually good on stock with the required modules for outfitting as requested. \n \n-  Open Unlimited : any space-worthy contraption is good to go, as long as no tuned parts are installed. Yes, this is a Beluga-friendly race! If you can stand the abysmal stock jump range, and find a spot where to land it, that is ( wink wink ). \n \n STEP BY STEP COURSE INSTRUCTIONS \n \n \n  While docked at London Relay, take a screenshot of the station main screen showing your credits, and another of your module panel showing your ship's loadout  (the regulation Adder list should fit in one screenshot, grab more accordingly to the equipped ship) . \n  Take another screenshot before launching with the clock visible, this will count as the start time of your entry. \n  Go, go, go! \n  Reach Bridger Town in Chi Herculis, land there and take a screenshot when docked with station clock visible. \n  Depart immediately and head for Cooper Arena; once there, find a suitable spot to land that is no less than 8 km away from the settlement. \n  Take a screenshot in the landed ship, showing both clock and distance to settlement. This will count as your SRV section start time. \n  Reach Cooper Arena; once there, scan the data point and take a screenshot showing the scan confirmation message and the clock. \n  Get away from Cooper arena and take a screenshot when you have driven at least 5 km away from it before returning to your ship ( the ship can be recalled at any time, just make sure to have traveled 5 km away as requested before boarding it ) \n  Take another screenshot as soon as you stop under your ship ready for boarding. The screenshot must show the clock, 0 m/s speed and the  \" Board ship \"  light on. This will count as your SRV section finish time.  (sorry for asking you two screenshots for the recall part; during test runs I noticed that the ship had an habit of landing several hundred meters back before the 5 km line, making it impossible to prove to have traveled the required distance in a single capture) \n  Depart and fly back to London Relay in Epsilon Indi \n  Once docked, take a screenshot showing your hull and the station clock, this will count as the finish time of the complete entry. \n  Take a last screenshot of the station main screen showing again your credits. For the entry to be valid, this value must be the same as the starting one  (NO refuel or repair during race) . \n Here is an annotated example of what your resulting screenshots should look like; please note that the Heat Bonus, Frequent Flyer and Big Air ones are optional - don't peek at the clock trying to deduce my time, I've taken the looong way around  ) \n[IMGUR]OMMsm[/IMGUR] \n \n IMPORTANT NOTE : given the nature of the game's data point scanning mechanics, it's only possible to do a proper scan of a data point once about every 15 days (I'll be pleased to be corrected if I'm wrong), trying to repeatedly scan the same data point will return the message  \" Package already accessed \"  after a far shorter scan time. For this reason, a screenshot with this message  is totally valid; more so, I strongly suggest to do a survey of the Cooper Arena settlement before diving head-first in the race, to shorten your scan time for subsequent attempt as well as for planning your possible landing and departing points. \n \nIf you did everything right for the mandatory requirements, you should find yourself with no less than 10 screenshots. Or a nice video from which to grab those. Sorry I know, that's quite a lot of them. \nBut it's not over yet! Now on to the bonus stuff! \n \n HEAT / HULL TIME BONUSES \n \nIf you thought this was all too straightforward until now, you were right. It's not a Buckyball race without some quirks thrown in the mix! Good news, this time around there aren't that many quirks. Bad news, those couple of quirks that remain have the word  \" rebuy \"  written all over them. Lucky you, the Adder is a cheap b****rd... \n \nTo sum it up, the more you manage to overheat your ship during the run, the more of a bonus you get. Every two percent point above the 100% mark will count for a subtracted second from your total time, simple as that. Reach 220% heat and get your free one-whopping-minute time bonus! Beware: your FSD, thrusters and power distributors may have a different opinion about that. \n \nAs for the hull related bonus, it's an all-or-nothing business reserved for shieldless builds only: \n \n \n  be a smooth operator and bring your ship around the full course with a 100% unscathed hull to earn an additional 20 seconds bonus! \n  Or, go the complete nut way and smear the charred and battered remains of your flying machine all over the landing pad with just that 1% hull that somehow still keeps the whole thing together. It's happened several times before, I know you can do it. Pull the stunt off and enjoy another  full minute time bonus , you've deserved it. And now that you survived that, how about going for another run? It's all downhill from there! \n - To be eligible for the heat time bonus, your entry must include an additional screenshot showing the maximum overheating reached and the hud clock. \n- The hull time bonus can be applied to  shieldless entries only , no additional screenshot required. \n\t\t \n\t \n THE FREQUENT FLYERS CLUB AND BIG AIR CHALLENGE \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t This race is about flying as much as it is about driving. Those actors in the movie pulled some totally hilarious stunts in their driving scenes, why not prove to spectators that Buckyballers can do even better without multiple takes and fancy special effects? This is what these two challenges are for. \n \n FREQUENT FLYERS CLUB \n \nEvery skilled SRV operator knows that driving fast is more about keeping the wheels detached from the ground, than actually rolling over it. Prove your might by competing for the most distance traveled in full flight in a single hop. Additional evidence is required to be eligible for this challenge, either by video or in the form of two additional (yes, another two!) screenshots; one just after your SRV has left the ground and another just before you touch down. Distance to/from Cooper must be visible in both to calculate the actual distance traveled in flight. \n \n BIG AIR CHALLENGE \n \nA returning one from the well received Total Recall 2 event, it requires competitors to provide an additional (and also last one, I swear!) screenshot showing the maximum height attained at any point during the SRV part of the race.  \n \nThose two challenges are optional and don't count in any way for the final standings of the main event. For both challenges, the screenshots must also show the hud clock to prove that they are from a valid run. The FFC and BAC standings will report the best entries out of any valid run submitted by any participant.  A submission that improves those optional entries but not the main total time will not be considered valid and won't count for any board. \n\t\t \n\t \n OK, I WANT TO TRY THIS! HOW DO I ENTER? \n \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Declare your intent to race in this thread by providing the following informations: \n- Cmdr name \n- Forum username (if different from cmdr name) \n- Race class  \n- Ship name \n- Ship type \n- SRV name \n \nWhen you have completed your run, click on the SUBMIT TIME button right below here or under the banner at the top and enter all the required information, together with a link to your (insane amount of) screenshot or video evidence. Any upload service like  Imgur  or the likes will do. If you recorded a video of your run but have problems with or can't wait for the uploading times, I strongly suggest you grab the required screenshots from the video and send those instead (and you'll also make me a favour for checking evidence, you can't even imagine the amount of lazyness going on here). \n \n >  SUBMIT TIME  < ​ \n \n\t\t \n\t \n FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t - Can I run in any game mode? \nYes, whether you prefer to play in Open, Solo or Private Group, all is fine as long as you follow the race rules. Of course Open is the suggested game mode, if only for the chance of meeting other runners on the course; since London Relay may be quite a busy port at times though, if you fear you may create troubles for unaware cmdrs with your flying stunts you are free to go the Solo or PG way. \n \n - Are engineers modifications allowed in this race? \nAs reported above in the full rules, no, they aren't allowed in any form (even enhanced performance thrusters are prohibited). If you'd like to enter the race in a ship of yours but you have modded even the coffee machine out of it, remember you can store your engineered modules and temporarily swap them for some stock ones. Also remember that stock coffee machines produce just an awful brown crap. \n \n - And what about synthesis? \nSynthesis isn't allowed as well for the flying part of the race. No FSD boost or anything else. However, IT IS allowed for the SRV part. If you find yourself mid-air in your rover coming down at 100+ m/s with a 4% hull, a literal on-the-fly repair is more than welcome! \n \n - Is there any prize for the winner? \nBad news here, the folks over at Clayakarma Electronics just confirmed that all the available budget for any potential prize has been diverted over the production of other promotional merchandise, namely a line-up of boxers with the phrase  \" Grab the Package \"  stamped on the front, and  \" Beware of the fumarole \"  on the back. Actually, no less than three pairs of those were produced with the given budget. \n \n - Can I run this in multicrew? \nYes absolutely, multicrew is encouraged with any ship meeting the requirements ( regulation Adder, hint hint ). Beware though, that due to the (current?) lack of SRV multicrew support, it's impossible to deploy the rover while a multicrew session is active. If you want to be able to effectively complete a run, remember to disband the crew BEFORE landing! \n \n - Lots of screenshots, videos and such, but what's there to actually stop me from cheating? \nActually, nothing. There's nothing I can do to stop you from manipulating screenshots or exploiting any possible hole in the rules. The Buckyball Racing Club operates on a reciprocal trust and honour basis (I'd say  \" gentlemen's agreement \" , but it doesn't sound right since we have several ladies making up the ranks). The only prize available here is the fun of having tried your best, or the satisfaction of succeeding at being the best. By cheating you'd mostly cheat yourself out of all the fun. \n\t\t \n\t \n FREQUENTLY QUESTIONED ASKINGS \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t - But really, no engineering at all? Not even a bit? Pretty please? \nNo, I've said no! Stop bothering me with this, and get your 700+ m/s Courier out of my sight!  \n *swooosh*  Damn, that zipped out of sight pretty fast indeed! \n \n - A time bonus for ending with 1% hull? Is this serious? \nAbsolutely, positively so. I know you can make it, and the rebuy in smaller ships is trivial anyway. Oh, and about those rumours someone spread around of me owning major shares in the insurance market, those are just that. Petty rumours from malicious people, don't trust them. \n \n - Where can I actually find this movie we are doing promotional stuff for? \nClayakarma Electronics stated it will be available soon on all major channels, but we can expect Galnetflix to have a 18-24 years exclusive on it, as usual. \n \n - Hey, I remember someone once making a  \" modernized reboot \"  of another movie with a strikingly similar title and plot to that! Is it so? \nNo, totally not I can guarantee. It never, ever happened. Never, I said. \n \n - Are you sure? No because really, I was pretty sure that...let me chek...here it is! We're talking more than 1000 years ago back in 2003, it was called  \" The Ital-wait, what are you doing-no no, I was just-*# \n *Muffled fighting and chocking sounds* ...Ahhh, uff...ehm, as I said above. It. Never. Happened. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t

There is no single starting/finish location, though the Heat Sink Pub at Treschov Ring/Banapityas A5 will be serving round the clock for Buckyballers looking for a place to hang their helmets between runs. \n \" Time is money. \" \n--CMDR Franklin \n \nWinners will be determined by calculating  \" Profit Per Second \"  - that is, the amount of credits earned divided by Total Time in Seconds. The more tonnage your ship can haul, the more profit you will make, but fuel costs and damage to your ship will cut into your profit and reduce your PPS. All ship types will run together, but a winner will be declared for each Type (6,7,9) in addition to the pilot with the greatest PPS. \n \" Have you got a 27B/6? Sorry, I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures? \" \n--CMDR Lowry \n \nThe Rules \n \n Lakon Types 6, 7, and 9 only in this race. \n Races can be flown in any mode (Open/Solo/Private) \n Pilots start, trade, and finish at any port of their choosing as long as they adhere to the flight plan.  \n Type-6's may utilize medium pads on any platfoem as they see fit. \n Engineering and premium resources  (jumponium, etc) are legal. \n Use of trade tools like EDDB is legal and encouraged. \n Doing business through the Contact Board is forbidden. (No missions, no bounties, no picking up additional credits outside of trading commodities.) \n Fuel and Repair costs will count against the PPS. \n Time in station screens for loading/unloading cargo, repairs, etc., all count against total time. \n Ships must be refuelled and repaired at the end of the race for proper PPS calculation. \n IMPORTANT NOTE FOR CMDRs: Unlike most races, the dash clock will not be the timekeeper of record as takeoff and landing are secondary to when cargo is loaded/offloaded. The clock on the Commodities Screen should be captured after a ship's hold is full, and the final screenshot of the race will be the Station Services screen showing the time, pilot's location, credit balance and ship status.  \n The race ends 23 APR, 00:00 Galactic Standard Time. Race submissions submitted after will be accepted as long as the start time is before 23:59 on the 23rd. \n \" Honey, got no money, I'm all sixes and sevens and nines. \" \n--CMDRs Richards, Jagger \n \n To Enter: \nReply to this thread with your CMDR Name, Ship Name, Ship Type and Cargo Capacity \n \n To Race: \n \n Research your route, find the one with the best commodities. Remember you can start and finish the race anywhere in Banapityas, and stop at any station when in U Carinae or Sounti. \n Open the Commodities Screen and take Screenshot #1 if not recording video.  IMPORTANT : take this screenshot BEFORE you purchase cargo, or it will affect your starting balance/PPS rating in the end. Before purchase is also the start time of record for videographers, so purchase and launch quickly! \n Launch and head to either U Carinae or Sounti.  \n Dock at any station and sell your goods. Load up your second haul, take the Second Screenshot of the Commodities screen. \n Return to Banapityas, dock at the station of your choice, sell your goods. \n Pick up your next order and take Screenshot #3 in the Commodities screen showing your payload. \n Fly to whichever system you have not visited and dock at the station of choice to sell your cargo. Pick up your final payload and take Screenshot #4 of the Commodities screen. \n Return to Banapityas and dock at the port of your choice. Land, and sell your final payload. Return to the station screen, Repair/Refuel/Restock All and take Screenshot #5, showing the time, location, and your credit balance. \n Use the SUBMIT TIME button to open the Official BRC Heavy Metal Submission Form (Link below the leaderboard) to enter your race details including the location of your screenshots. (Note if you take video but don't want to wait to encode and post it, play it back and take screenshots at the appropriate points.) \n Sit back, relax, and wait for the next Leaderboard Update. Or, if you think you can do better, run it again! \n Note: Please do not post your race results in the thread. If you don't have an image host, fill out the form and use  http://attachment.com  as the location and PM me your attachments.  \nAnother Note: Times/PPS will not be posted until the final day. A daily race report will indicate how close competitors are, and if a CMDR is particularly curious, he or she may PM ElectricZ on the forum for an exact number after submitting a time. \n \nLadies and Gentlemen, start your FSD's! And heavens help oncoming traffic in the slot... \n \nHow did we get here? The story behind  Heavy Metal: \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \" The best ideas come out of bar bets. Who wants another drink? \" \n-- CMDR ElectricZ \n \nGather 'round, CMDRs, and listen to the tale of a little system called Banapityas where one of the most widely traded commodities is bad decisions. A thriving Agricultural/Refinery system with 1.5 billion people and a dozen ports of call, Banapityas is a hub for commerce in its sector. The refineries of nearby systems U Carinae and Sounti are hungry for metals from Banapityas as well as foodstuffs from Banapityas A5. In orbit of A5, Treshchov Ring is home to Mercurial Spirits, whose marketing strategy of churning out booze so corrosive it had to be bottled in recycled reactor shielding makes it the #2 export of the system. Incidentally, When serving drinks mixed with Mercurial Spirits, it is highly recommended to use official Buckyball Beer Mats, now available at the BRC home station of Rebuy Prospect, now open for business in the Fullerene C-60 system. (Rebuy Prospect -  \" Crash Here Anytime. \" ) \n \nOur story begins 12 April, 3303 with a Lakon Type-9 named Patience and her master, one CMDR Vikram Rando. Rando is your typical heavy hauler, more interested in a fat paycheck than fancy flying, who stopped in for a quick stop at a spacer pub called The Heat Sink while on turnaround at Treshchov. While alcohol is the catalyst for many unwise decisions throughout history, it's most potent when mixed with a splash of ego.  \n \nAfter CMDR Rando's 7th drink in his self-imposed 2-drink limit, his love of Patience proved too great to keep to himself. In an epic ten minute, alcohol infused soliloquy to his beloved Type-9, he proclaimed pilots of all other Lakons at the pub to be  \" no more significant than the ZP Haulers I scrape from my windscreen after every landing. \"  Rando's loud proclamations caught the attention of CMDR Suze  \" The Fuze \"  Garber, master of the Lakon Type-6 Busted Flat II. Garber, herself fueled by equal parts pride, Mercurial Vodka, and the inherent jealousy of a freighter jock who can't afford a Type-9, accused Rando of hauling weapons-grade biowaste and stated that credit per credit, ton per ton, the ship with the best Commander at the helm would make the most profit, regardless of capacity, be it a Lakon Type Six, a Nine or a Tweleven. (Garber's speech had become somewhat slurred by this time.) \n \nRando focused on the  leftmost of the three Garbers he could see and uttered those magic words any Buckyballer loves to hear.  \" Wanna bet? \"   \n \nBookies in Banapityas are giving odds on whether Rando or Garber even make it out of port, so to increase the betting action, they sent a collective invitation to the pilots of the BRC and anyone else interested in denting some landing pads. \n\t\t \n\t \n \nAnd just to get this Buckyball rolling... \n \nCMDR ElectricZ \n \" Magnum Errat \" \nType 9 \n490t capacity

starting and ending at Haisheng Orbital in Noatiaca. \nThe route is as shown: \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nTo complete the race the pilot must do one circuit starting at Haisheng Orbital, visiting each waypoint in turn and returning to Haisheng. \n \nThere are two race classes: \n Unlimited : \n \n Any ship may enter \n Engineer mods, Enhanced Performance Thrusters and FSD boost are allowed \n Multiple leaderboard entries (best submission for each ship type will appear separately) \n Old-School Cool : \n \n Ships allowed: Cobra MkIII, Viper MkIII, Eagle, Hauler, Sidewinder (no restrictions on basic outfitting) \n Engineer mods, Enhanced Performance Thrusters and FSD boost are disallowed \n Single leaderboard entry (you can run as many times as you like, only your best time will be used) \n As you can see, this is a very simple race with no additional complications. \n \nHm... Actually hang on, what does this button do? \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n... Oh. \n \n \n The Options \n \nYou may choose to race according to certain conditions as defined above, to have time subtracted from your final race time. \nWhich options you take is entirely up to you - you can choose to do none, or if you really want to you can try to do all of them (although that may be a little optimistic!) \n \nCertain options will require extra evidence as detailed below. A full run video is an acceptable (and highly recommended!) replacement for extra evidence. \nLow performance impact video recording can be done on most PCs using  OBS , or using  Shadowplay  for Nvidia GPUs or  Raptr  for AMD GPUs. \n \nAdditional details on specific options: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Clarifications/restrictions: \n \n Pulling Your Weight : You can't be carrying shields -  all  optional internals must be full-size cargo racks. \n Disregard the Constabulary : You must have at least one offensive weapon on board. \n Disregard the Constabulary : Hardpoints must be deployed around or before entering the no-fire zone, and must be kept out at least until through the slot. 20% is removed from the bonus each time you forget. \n Status: Friendly : You must do this every time you approach a station; 20% is removed from the bonus each time you forget. \n Status: Friendly : Station name must be in full (both words) and spelled correctly in the sent chat message: 10% is removed from the bonus for typos! Also no copy-pasting or macros!  \n Ten Year Plan : The modules must spell DECADE in order, with the first D being the Power Plant all the way down to E Sensors. \n Race-About-Face : You must be going fully backwards as you go through the slot - centre of forward view must be facing towards back of station/out into space as appropriate. 20% is removed from the bonus for each time this isn't the case. \n Race-About-Face : You can head towards the slot however you like, as long as you are facing fully backwards when travelling through it. \n Race-About-Face : Mass numbers are based on hull mass (as shown in the hull column on  Coriolis ),  not  with modules fitted. \n Additional evidence requirements: \n \n Pulling Your Weight : additional screenshot of cargo tab/commodities market before launch \n Disregard the Constabulary : screenshots on approach and departure of each waypoint showing hardpoints deployed \n Status: Friendly : screenshots on approach to each waypoint showing text in local chat \n Race-About-Face : screenshots while passing through the slot facing backwards for each entry and exit. \n If you intend to try these options, it is  highly  recommended to take video recording of your run rather than hammering your poor screenshot key. Also it means you have hilarious video evidence when things go wrong.  \n\t\t \n\t \n \n How do I enter? \n \nThe basics are covered in  the BRC's guide on entering races . \n \nDuring the event, you're allowed to submit  provisional evidence  consisting of a start and end screenshot. This is so you don't have to organise and upload a ton of screenshots only to produce a better time five minutes later. \nBy the end of the event, though, you'll have to produce full evidence for your best run(s), which will consist of: \n \n Outfitting screenshots (1 x hardpoints, 1-2 x core internals, 1-2 x optional internals) \n Start screenshot (on the pad at Haisheng Orbital) \n Waypoint screenshots (on the pad at Covey Gateway, Lukyanenko Vision and Swanson Port) \n End screenshot (on the pad at Haisheng Orbital) \n Any extra screenshots for advanced options \n As above, a full run video can be used as replacement for these screenshots as long as it shows the relevant information. \n \nSo, as a whole you'll need to provide the following information when you submit times: \n \n CMDR name and forum username \n Race class \n Ship type and name \n Race time  without  any adjustments applied ( handy calculator ) \n Which Advanced options you used \n Link to screenshots on image hosting site (e.g.  imgur ) and/or run video \n Send that big pile of info to me either  by forum PM  or as an email to  alot@buckyballracing.org.uk . \n \nPlease submit your times within  48 hours  of running the race so the scoreboard can (hopefully) be updated in a timely manner. The race organiser reserves the right to penalise late submissions!  \n \nOne final note: some racers have reported that using the non-Horizons client (the normal Elite Dangerous one) can result in faster hyperspace jumps. If you really want to shave those extra seconds, consider making the switch! \n \n \nSo... Tweak your ships, fire up your engines ... and choose wisely. Submissions are open.

You can optionally fly through up to 3 further tunnels per location to earn extra time bonuses. \n \nAny type of tunnel will do as long as it has an entrance and an exit (flying into and then reversing back out of a blocked tunnel doesn't really count). You are permitted to fly through the same tunnel more than once, you can even pull a 180, reverse your momentum and fly straight back through the tunnel you just came out of (although this might not always be the fastest nor most satisfying route to take). \n \nThe race starts at 00:00 on Saturday 25th February 3303 and runs until midnight on Monday 6th March 3303 (in-game). You can run as many times as you like and submit as many race entries as you like (although the scoreboard will only show your best time). \n \n Tunnel bonuses \n \nYou will earn a time bonus for your run based on a combination of ship mass (the MLF value taken from  Coriolis ) and the number of tunnels you fly through. This bonus will be subtracted from your elapsed race time to produce your final race time. \n \nThe bonus (in seconds) is calculated as  (0.75 x MLF)  per tunnel (including the compulsory first one) plus additional 5, 10 and 15 second bonuses for tackling the optional 2nd, 3rd and 4th tunnels. \n \nExamples .. \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t A Python  (MLF = 17)  completes the course in  30m , managing all  4  tunnels at  2  of the sites but just  2  tunnels at the other (a total of  10  tunnels). \nIt's bonus is  (0.75 x 17 x 10) +  (5 + 10 + 15) + (5 + 10 + 15) + (5) = 192.5s . \nIt's final time will be  26m47s . \n \nAn Imperial Courier  (MLF = 7)  completes the course in  29m , managing all  4  tunnels at all  4  sites (a total of  12  tunnels). \nIt's bonus is  (0.75 x 7 x 12) + (5 + 10 + 15) + (5 + 10 + 15) + (5 + 10 + 15) = 153s . \nIt's final time will be  26m27s . \n\t\t \n\t \n I'm not a mathematician, what the hell does all that mean? \n \nBasically I've tried (quite hard) to weight the results so that there's a decent (but not unbeatable) benefit to steering a larger ship through the tunnels should you be bold enough to try it. I honestly don't know if the really large ships will even fit (although I have a hunch  ) but I've done a fair bit of testing with the Python vs. the iCourier and I'll just say that it's conceivable that a ship like the former could even win this race (for the first time in Buckyball history I think). \n \n Your race submission \n \nYour race submission will need a pre-launch screenshot at Leopold Heckmann Ring (clearly showing the station clock), a post-landing screenshot at Evans port (again showing the station clock), two capital ship dock screenshots, plus screenshots taken inside each tunnel clearly showing the tunnel exit plus the HUD clock (top right), the system name (bottom left) and a positive forward speed. \n \nThis is what your capital ship dock screenshots should look like .. \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nFly through any of the sections circled in red! \n\t\t \n\t \n And this is what your tunnel screenshots should look like ... \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t n.b. the red circles are for illustration only, you do not need to circle your own images. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nNote: the following is not valid since it does not show the exit. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n If you successfully navigate four tunnels at each site then there should be 16 screenshots in total. Gosh, sorry ... that's a lot. If you prefer you can submit video evidence of your run. It might be a good idea to video your run anyway so you can grab any missing screenhots from the video (nothing worse than completing a world beating run only to discover you've dropped a screenshot). \n \nThe easiest and best way to submit evidence is to upload your screenshots to the free  Imgur  on-line image sharing service and send me a link to the album (I'd appreciate it if you could arrange the images in  the correct order) and I guess the easiest way to submit video evidence would be to upload your video to Youtube and send me its URL. \n \nAlong with the link to your photographic evidence your submissions(s) should also include your commander name, game mode, ship type, the name of your ship, your elapsed time (which can be calculated  here ) and the number of tunnels you managed to complete at each of the three sites. \n \nExample .. \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Cmdr Alec Turner \nMode: Open \nShip type: Python \nShip name: The Call-out Charge \nTime: 25:37 \nTunnels: 4 + 4 + 4 \n\t\t \n\t \n Race submissions should be sent to me, either via a  pm  here on the forum or else via an email to  alec.turner@buckyballracing.org.uk . Race submissions will be accepted from 00:00 on 25.02.3303 until midnight on 06.03.3303. \n \nNote: Only entries made in Open play will be eligible for the race leaderboard! \n \n The  \" Win It or Bin It \"  joker card \n \nCompetitors can choose to play a  \" joker \"  card with their race submission in order to qualify for an additional time bonus. The run must be made in a ship without shields and the time bonus will be half of the remaining hull percentage as shown in the final landing screenshot (for example if you landed with 78% hull remaining then 39 seconds would be deducted from your final time). Use of the joker must be declared within 24hrs of the run itself and you can only play one joker per ship type. \n \n Cheating \n \nSince it's difficult to prove that you've really flown through the all tunnels you claim to have flown through (without making video evidence compulsory, which I'm not going to do) this race is especially susceptible to cheating. However, as there's no prize for winning other than the personal sense of pride you will feel for doing so, you really would only be cheating yourself. And that's all I have to say about that. \n \n What do I do now? \n \nThe race starts on Saturday 25th Feb 3303. Until then you can read the rules, have a practice if you like, decide what ship(s) you're going to run in and by all means post in this thread to state your intention to take part and/or to ask any further questions. \n \n Demonstration video \n \n[video=youtube_share;ouaCqM2kE7E]https://youtu.be/ouaCqM2kE7E[/video] \n \nNote: order of installations shown in this video should not be taken as any indication of a decent route. \n \n \nAlternatively, for a far more informative and  \" leisurely \"  introduction to the race ... \n \n[video=youtube_share;PCc_ixGpr-0]https://youtu.be/PCc_ixGpr-0[/video] \n[SUB](thanks and credit to artigan99 for putting this together)[/SUB] \n \n FAQ \n \nQ) Are engineer mod's considered kosher for use in this race? \nA) Yes - you may engineer the bejesus out of your ship if you like (it won't make you a better pilot you know!). Please note however that the use of Jumponium to boost your ship's jump range is strictly prohibited! \n \nQ) Can we use SLFs? Please. Can we? \nA) No. Sorry.

Refer to the  Buckyballer's guide to Engineering  for advice. \n \n [size=+2] RACE RULES AND REGULATIONS [/size] \n [size=+1] Rules [/size] \n \n Start at  Forward Horizons  on  Orrere 2 D . \n Retrieve cargo from the  Crashed Ship  POI at  43.82, -173.97  on  Orrere 2 B . \n Finish at  Guin Survey  on  Orrere 2 B . \n Alternatively, start at  Guin Survey  and finish at  Forward Horizons . \nPlay your single-use Joker card to earn a time bonus of up to 20 seconds. \n \nThe crashed Anaconda appears as a static POI and is visible in the navigation panel when you are within 1000Ls. \n \n You won't be able to see the POI until you land and scan the  ship data core  at the site.  After that it will show up in the navigation panel. \n \nThe ship spawns with a number of cargo canisters and materials; you can collect any one of them.  The items usually only appear on the target panel of a small ship or SRV so you will probably need to deploy a vehicle, collect the cargo and transfer it to your large ship.  However, landing and deploying your SRV is  optional  as long as you scoop up at least one object. \n \n [size=+1] The joker [/size] \n \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n The joker card may be played  once  per competitor. \n \nA competitor must declare his intention to play the joker within  24 hours  of starting his race run.  Declarations made after this time will be rejected; the joker card may be retained for later use.   Note: Evidence of completing the race may be submitted at any time up to and including the deadline for submissions; only the intention to play the joker must be made within 24 hours. \n \nThe joker card may only be used when a competitor meets  all  of the following conditions: \n \n His ship is fitted with Lightweight Alloys with no engineer modifications. \n His ship is not fitted with any Hull Reinforcement Packages. \n His ship is not fitted with any Module Reinforcement Packages. \n His ship is not fitted with a Shield Generator. \n \nValid use of the joker card entitles the competitor to reduce his final time by  1 second  per  5%  hull remaining (rounded down) at the end of the race, up to a maximum of  20 seconds .  For instance if he finishes the race with 86% hull strength he will receive a  17 second  bonus. \n \n [size=+2] CLASSIFICATION [/size] \n \n R S E CMDR name Forum name Ship name Ship type Callsign Bonus Raced Total 1 1 j,t cookiehole cookiehole Momentum Conservation Eagle [size=-2]Core Dynamics Charlie Oscar Oscar[/size] 00:00:18 00:04:52 00:04:34 2 1 t Aken B.

Enhanced Performance Thrusters count as engineering. \n A screenshot of your ship on the pad at  Forward Horizons  showing the station clock.  The time shown will be your start time for the entry. \n A screenshot of your ship or SRV collecting cargo at the  Crashed Ship  POI on Orrere 2 B showing the HUD clock. \n A screenshot of your ship on the pad at  Guin Survey  showing the station clock.  The time shown will be your finish time for the entry. \n You may also choose to fly the course in reverse, in which case your first screenshot should be taken at  Guin Survey  and your third at  Forward Horizons . \n \nVideo entries will also be accepted as substitutes for screenshots. \n \nYour screenshot for the cargo collection stage should show the  CARGO ACQUIRED  message at the left of the HUD: \n \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n Screenshots \nScreenshots may be taken using the in-game screenshot function (F10 key) or your choice of third-party software.  If you are recording a video of your entry you can submit snapshots of individual frames showing each checkpoint. \n \n Videos \nYou may also submit an entry with a video.  You may edit your video down to a shorter running time as long as the takeoff, scooping and landing are shown. \n \nThis forum has direct support for Youtube videos.  To post your video in this thread, use the [video=youtube] tag with your video's Youtube ID, for example  [video=youtube;6Pk5rjMu11Q]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk5rjMu11Q[/video] . \n \nYou are of course free to use a video host other than Youtube. \n \n [size=+2] QUESTIONS [/size] \n Do I have to post an intent to race before competing? \nNot if you don't want to.  It's cool if you do, so other racers can look out for you on the course, but it's optional. \n \n I can't find the crashed ship! \nIt's at  43.82, -173.97 .  Fly there once and deploy your SRV.  Then you can scan the  ship data core .  After that the POI will always be visible within 1000Ls. \n \n Are Engineer modifications allowed in this race? \nYes.  However in order to be eligible to use the  \" Win it or bin it \"  joker card you may not fit any modification which increases your hull strength or resistances. \n \n Is synthesis allowed in this race? \nYes.  It won't help very much but you can use it. \n \n I refuse to play in Open \nYou are welcome to run the course in Private Group or Solo mode and submit an entry.  Your attempt will appear on the leaderboard as an exhibition run and be excluded from ranking but you will still be able to compare your efforts to others'. \n \n The joker doesn't offer a very large bonus \nIt is expected that the best pilots will fly this course very quickly and even 20 seconds will be a significant margin at the top of the leaderboard.

No docking is required except at the finish line when you return to Avogadro Enterprise.  Pilots are encouraged to utilize the supercharging of frame shift drives when near these white dwarf stars. \n \n BASICS \n This is a modified  \" scramble \"  race: \n \n \n Get pre-launch screenshots while docked at Avogadro Enterprise in Tau Ceti. \n Launch. \n Visit the 7 other stations listed below in any order. \n Docking is  NOT  required. \n \n Take a screenshot of each station exterior, showing its name. \n Use white dwarf supercharging to travel farther, faster. \n \n THE ROUTE \n Start and finish at Avogadro Enterprise in Tau Ceti, then visit all of the other stations in this list, in any order. \n \n \n Station System Supercruie Dist.

This is because the race is more interested in testing a pilot's supercruise approach when there is no opportunity for gravity braking, than in testing docking/launch accuracy, which most other races cover. \n \nSo instead of the usual screenshot taken on the pad, we will be taking screenshots of the station exteriors, as follows: \n \n \n Target each station. \n Approach to within 1.5 km and take a screenshot. The shot must clearly show: \n The ship's HUD clock; \n Targeting info showing the distance to the station; \n The station's name printed on the station. \n \n \n DECLARING INTENT TO RACE Before racing, it is customary to declare your intent to race by posting in the thread, but it is not strictly necessary. To declare your intent, specify the following: \n \n CMDR Name (forum alias) \n Ship Name  (ship type) \nRace Class ​ \n So my intent to race might look like: \nCMDR Seneh (Jhyrryl) \n Black  (Adder) \nPro ​ \nThe same information must be submitted with your race entry. \n \n RULES  &  PROCEDURES \n Make sure you are playing in open and park your ship at  Avogadro Enterprise in Tau Ceti . Proceed as follows: \n \n \n Collect visual evidence of your ship's outfitting (see the official  How to Enter  instructions). \n Collect visual evidence of your start (see the official  How to Enter  instructions). \n Travel your chosen route. \n Collect visual evidence as described above. \n Return to Avogadro Enterprise in Tau Ceti and collect visual evidence of your ship back on the pad. \n Upload your screenshots to imgur.com or another appropriate hosting site. \n Submit all visual evidence and other required info for your race entry to me via the forum's private message service (preferred) or email to jhyrryl < at > buckyballracing < dot > org < dot > uk. \n \n F.A.Q. \n Q :  Is FSD supercharging required? \n A : No. \n \n Q :  Can I provide video evidence? \n A : Yes, but only if you provide timestamps for the moments when you would have taken a required screenshot. \n \n Q :  Some of these supercruise distances are really far away. \n A : That's not a question. \n \n Q :  Why are some of these supercruise distances so far away? \n A : These are the only stations that met the requirements of the race organizer.  Besides, being farther away from a star makes it more difficult for pilots to sync up their speed for dropping out of SC, due to travelling faster in the outer reaches of a system, and are therefore better for testing the skills of this race.

She'll be supervising all race entries, and specifically ww \n \nThe younger sister, Mayte  \"  Rodrigues, is infamous in security offices across the federation for her hot-rodding and tower-buzzing \n\t\t \n\t \n New to racing? \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t How do I even do the speedy go-fast zoomie thing?! \nPlease refer to the following instructional video, generously commissioned by Anthony and Enoch Lonnegan*, produced by Furrycat:  < font color= \" #1155CC \" > < u > < a href= \" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk5rjMu11Q \"  target= \" _blank \"  rel= \" nofollow \" > [video=youtube;6Pk5rjMu11Q]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk5rjMu11Q[/video] \n \n*Drinx Inx has no formal associations with the Brother Lonnegan, nor has any rivalry between our executives and the Lonnegan brothers ever been proven in open court, nor has the Evil Juice incident at EDA-Penitentiary ever been tied to our board. \n \nDon't worry too much about all the rules and regulations below.

Saunders's Dive, Wolf 1301 \n\t\t \n\t \n Proof and Submissions \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t How am I going to be the speediest smuggling of all when I’m constantly pausing to check and see if I took a screenshot?    \nI don’t know, that sounds like a TERRIBLE idea! \nThat’s why it’s HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use video capture to record your run, and obtain screenshots from the video capture later.  Most video cards have software that will enable video capture without excessive performance impact, for eample,  Plays.tv  for AMD,  Shadowplay  for Nvidia, and  Game DVR  for Xbox. \n \n \nDo I have to use screenshots? \nScreenshots are the fastest and lowest bandwidth way to submit your run, but if you wish to upload a full video and link to that instead, that would be great! \nIf you’re feeling kind, please provide timestamps for the beginning, commodity, and final screenshot times. \n \n So how many of these do I need to take? \n1. Commodities page at starting station with empty cargo hold less than 5 minutes before start time. \n2. On landing pad with station clock showing at first station. This is your “start time”. \n3-8. Commodities pages when buying them \n9. Touchdown at least 4km from  Gelfand Lab .  Distance from Gelfand Lab must be visible from SRV screen. \n10. Flyover of  Gelfand Lab   Must include SRV screenshot where height - distance  <  100m.  Include optional screenshots of highest positive speed with base visible  <  1km from base. \n12. Landing pad is  Planck Orbital  showing station clock time.  This is your “finish time”. \n13. Commodities page. \n \n What if I want to show off my sweet ride and skills? \nBeauty or action screenshots using the Classified camera of your ship or buggy are welcome and will be used in Drinx. Inx. promotional materials! \n \nYou will need to upload screenshots or a video somewhere safe and link it.  I recommend  imgur  or  youtube .  Submit your run using  this form . \n\t\t \n\t \n Classes \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t YT-1300 Cobra \n A standard  smuggler’s loadout  for the Cobra Mk. III.  She may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts. \nThe Cobra is somewhat pricier than the average stock loadout for a Buckyball race. \nIf any financial assistance is necessary, don’t hesitate to contact CMDR Bruski, he’ll happily provide it so that Buckyballing can be for everyone. \n \n Changes from default loadout: \n \n \n A-Rated FSD \n All other modules D-rated \n 4D Fuel scoop added \n Cargo racks maximized \n Fuel tank shrunk \n Removed weapons and shield \n Added Chaff and Heat Sink \n Adv or Int Disco Scanners are fine \n Cosmetic changes are encouraged (livery, spoilers, ship part kits, decals, etc) \n \n High as a Kite \nAny ship, any modules, any engineer upgrades. \nNo FSD injection. \n Drinx Inx. has discovered that mixing Jumponium with any drink can have unfortunate side effects, and this is not within Drinx Inx.’s safety policy, such as it is. \n \n Big is Beautiful \n Orcas only. \nAny modules. \nAny engineer upgrades. \nStill no Jumponiom. \nEach ton of ingredients delivered to Planck Orbital reduces final time by 5 seconds. \nThis will be verified via the final commodity screenshot. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Intent \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Is it customary (but not required) for Buckyballers to declare their intent to race before doing so, in something like the following format. \n \n \nIntent to Race \nCMDR Name (forum alias) \n Ship name  (ship type) \nRace Class \n \nExample: \nIntent to Get Crunk \nCMDR Bruski \n Sugar Glider  (Asp X) \nHigh as a Kite \n\t\t \n\t \n Challenges \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So it’s just about the time, right? \nNot at all!  In addition to competing for the lowest time, SRV daredeviling is highly encouraged for the delight of the crowds!  And you'll be encouraged to avoid those pesky Feds as well.  \n \n Crash n Smash! \n Smashing things makes the crowd go wild!  Especially because they're safe behind plastisteel windows. \nTake a screenshot of your lowest hull percentage, followed by a screenshot of your SRV cargo hold with a later timestamp to prove you didn't lose the goods in any of your  \" accidents \" . \n \n Speed  \n Going fast is the name of the game, but past hordes of eager onlookers is the best place to do it! \nSubmit a screenshot showing your SRV speed with distance to Gelfand  < 1km to complete for this special prize. \n \n Mix it UP! \n While not conventional science, we've figured out the flashiest way to mix things up is tumbling your buggy like a sidewinder hitting the toaster rack.  So see how many front or back flips you can do in one hop! \nNo barrel rolls please. \nVideo evidence only. \n \n Silent Speed Smuggling \n We can't have the feds finding out about this event before we launch our product, so keep it secret, and keep it safe. \nSpeed and silence is the only way to be sure about that, so this challenge combines both. \n \nTake a screenshot of your fastest speed inside a station in silent running mode. \nWhere you're going, you don't need no stinking shields.  \nInside the station can include the mailslot sides, but not the toast rack. \nScreenshot should be less than 60 seconds before a docking or buying screenshot, as splattering your ship on the back of the station is hardly stealthy.  \n\t\t \n\t \n FAQ \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Q: Is there a set start area or just in a station about to buy one of the mixers? \nThere is no set starting station.  You can start at any station you wish, presumably one that sells one of the ingredients. \nYou may purchase the ingredient from that station before starting the race. \nYou may not purchase an ingredient from another station, take it somewhere else, and then start. \nYou may only have the ingredient from your current location. \n \n Q:Is the YT-1300 Cobra a locked set up? E.g can I remove the shield? Extra excitement factor    \nYep, the YT-1300 and High as a Kite classes are locked, and you do not need a shield for silent running, so you don't get one.  \n \n Am I allowed to use permit locked systems e.g. Shinrarta Dezhra? \n Drinx Inx. scientists have determined that the supposed mineral benefits of the Waters of Shintara, as suspected by the vast majority of the scientific community, are, to use the technical term,  \" nonsense \" . \nAs we have only the HIGHEST standards for our beverages, they will not be accepted as ingredients for the maXXXXXer mixer challenge. \nAnything on the pre-approved list will be, whether it requires a permit or not. \nYou're welcome to pass through permit-locked systems on your route if you determine they are advantageous. \n \n Q: How the hell am I supposed to plot a course?! \n I'm sure your bright mind will figure something out.

The Pilot's Federation has asked the Buckyball racing club to assist them in investigating an aspect of pilot safety that has been causing them growing concern. Since the beginning of 3302 the Pilot's Federation has noticed a sharp increase in the number of crash landings reported on high gravity planets. In order to assess whether ship thrusters require an across the board power increase they have asked the Buckyball Racing Club to organise an event that involves pushing ships to their maximum tolerances during high gravity landings. \n \nTo this end, the Buckyball Racing club invites all interested pilots to gather at the Dog and Thargoid bar, Cook Gateway, Medzistha. The race consists of taking off from Cook Gateway, performing a single hyperspace jump to Omicron Capricorni B, land on planet A4, anywhere. Take off and return to Cook Gateway, Medzistha. \n \nPilots are warned that omicron Capricorni B, A 4 has a surface gravity of 4g and extreme caution should be exercised on exit from orbital cruise/glide. \n \nThe event will run from 0000 IGT/UTC 6th September until 2359 IGT/UTC 11th September 3302. Any runs must have a start time before 2359 IGT/UTC 11th September 3302 to be eligible. \n \n Final Results \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \nNew to Racing? \n \nPlease refer to the following instructional video, courtesy of CMDR furrycat: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk5rjMu11Q \n\t\t \n\t \n \nDon't worry too much about all the rules and regulations below it pretty easy once you give it a go. \n \n Rules and Regulations \n \nFirstly let me state that landing on high g planets is very tricky. If you have never done it before and attempt to land as normal you will likely see the insurance screen, so be warned! Choose a cheap ship or take it very steady until you have got the hang of it... \n \nThere are two classes the Regulation Hauler and Open Unlimited. \n \nThe regulation hauler must be outfitted as follows. It can be bought and outfitted at Cook Gateway. It is the stock hauler with a D class FSD to allow reaching Omicron Capricorni B in a single jump and the shields removed. The regulation hauler will qualify for a 10 second time reduction if the screenshot of it landed on omicron Capricorni B, A4 shows it with 100% hull. \n \n https://coriolis.io/outfit/hauler/0p4t4F3l4d4s4f217--0101-2h.Iw19A===.Aw19A=== \n \nIn Open Unlimited anything goes – Engineer’s modifications and FSD boosts are allowed. \n \nThis race requires the Elite Dangerous: Horizons expansion. \n \nWhen docked in station you must take a screen shot showing the on screen clock.

Firstly they wanted to express their gratitude for our previous data gathering exercise which helped them resolve the issues with their old SRV tyres (which weren't leaving any tracks) and release a new range of tyres which are now in use throughout the galaxy. Not only have these allowed commanders to draw genitalia on planets in every system from Kunti to Acokwang (yeah yeah OK, I know you can't land there but work with me here) but they also helped save commander Bomba Luigi from certain death, when he got stranded on the surface of planet Wilson and was able to mark out an SOS that was visible from space. \n \n https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/268862-Help-I-need-Ship-Rats%21 \n \nAlas not everyone has been quite so pleased with their new tyres. TrakMark (who have stated that the tyres are good for at least 10,000km) are currently fighting a number of law suits from commanders claiming the new tyres led to the destruction of SRV's after driving just a few kilometres away from their home. Normally this would be easy to disprove but unfortunately it turns out that all of these claims come from settlements who's placement is somewhat, ahem, challenging to say the least. \n \nThat's where you guys come in. TrakMark have sponsored a new race to prove that not only is it possible to easily drive at least 5km away from each of these settlements  but that it's possible to do so under racing conditions. \n \nIf you're interested in taking part in this event then sign-up by registering your intent to race in the thread below stating which class(es) you're planning to race in and the type of ship you'll be using. The TrakMark tyre company have also requested that you sign a written statement declaring that you will make no legal claims against their company in the event of any loss of SRV. \n \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n  [image courtesy of Cmdr disorganise] \n \n \n The Rules \n \n- Start at Kirkwood Vision in Cernobog. \n \n- Open the right-hand Status/Statistics panel and take a screenshot that shows your current SRV distance travelled (you'll need to scroll to the bottom of the Statistics section to find this). \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n - Take a screenshot showing the time on the station clock, launch and GO! \n \n- Fly to each of the four settlements listed for the race class you're entering. \n \n- On landing at each one take another screenshot showing the station clock and then deploy your SRV. \n \n- Drive away from the settlement, in whatever direction seems best to you. Target the settlement so that its distance is visible. When the distance shown is at least 5km, take another screenshot that shows both the distance and the time and then recall your ship and fly to the next destination. \n \n Note for pilots who took part in Total Recall 1: The rules have changed slightly here since most settlements have now reduced their minimum ship recall restriction zones to just 4km which TrakMark tyres considers to be an insufficient drive distance to adequately prove their point. \n \n- Once you've repeated this process for all four settlements fly to the designated finish line for your race class (note: they're different), land and take a final screenshot showing the time on the station clock. \n \n- Lastly, take another screenshot showing your SRV distance travelled which should now be around 20Km (0.02Mm) more than the original distance (don't worry if it's not exact). \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Email your set of screenshots    (there should be 12 in total) to  alec.turner@buckyballracing.org.uk   (I'd prefer it if you could upload these to somewhere like imgur.com  and then just send me a link to the album) along with the following  information: \n \n \n your commander name   \n your forum name (if different) \n   \n   the race class you're entering   \n the type of your ship \n   \n   the name of your ship \n   \n   the  total  elapsed time from start-time to finish-time (this  can be calculated by  feeding the times shown on those two screenshots  into the following  website:  http://www.timeanddate.com/date/timeduration.html# )    \n   \n Submissions will be accepted from 00:00:00 (in-game time) on Saturday 27th August 3302 until 23:59:59 on Sunday 4th September 3302.

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n The Buckyball Racing Club salutes the Heroes of Bast! \n \n The Glorious Bast-erds Race has now finished, but if you are looking for some racing action check out  Total Recall 2 \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t On 30th June 3301 Newton Dock in the BD-02 4304 system was quarantined due to the outbreak of a plague of unknown origin. The Cerberus Plague eventually spread to over 20 systems and claimed 100,000 lives. \n \nThanks to a massive effort by a group of independent pilots, a cure synthesised from Ceremonial Heike Tea was discovered and used to treat plague victims at Hart Station in the Bast System. This cure was then mass produced and shipped to other infected systems. \n \nOn 10th August 3301 the last infected systems were declared to be free of the Cerberus Plague. \n \nIn tribute to the heroic efforts of those glorious BAST-erds and Ceremonial Tea Baggers one year ago, the Buckyball Racing Club is hosting a racing event at Hart Station involving a scramble around nearby medicine production facilities and a speed run to Brunel City, Heike. \n \n Race Overview \n \n Glorious Bast-erds  is a racing tribute to the heroic efforts of the commanders (the Bast-erds) who completed several interlinked community goals during July and August 3301 to defeat the threat of the Cerberus Plague; the decisive three community goals were all based at Hart Station in the Bast System. The cure to the Cerberus Plague required the rare commodity Ceremonial Heike Tea. \n \nThe race involves starting at Hart Station in the Bast System, racing to a selection of nearby stations that manufacture medical goods, returning to Hart Station and then making a return trip to Brunel City (Heike) potentially using a second ship. \n \nStart from  Hart Station  in  Bast . Visit any  FOUR  of the following seven nearby high-tech stations in any order:  \nSuri Park(Anlave), Kobayashi City(Anlave), Chadwick Port(Gladutjin), Aleksandrov Gateway(LHS 115), Tanaka Terminal(LHS 2088), Lacaille Prospect(LHS 3262), Sy Base(LHS 3262). Return to Hart Station, while docked at Hart  you may switch ships if you like , then make a trip to Brunel City(Heike) and return to the finishing line at Hart Station. \n \nThe clock starts on departure from Hart Station, and ends on arrival of your final visit to Hart Station. \n \nThe race will run from midnight tonight (0:00:00 11-AUG-3302 in-game time) until 23:59:59 on  18th   21st  August. Participants must begin their run from Hart Station no later 23:59:59 GMT (in-game time) on  18th   21st  August to be valid entries. Race evidence should be provided no later than 23:59:59 on  19th   22nd  August. \n \n Regulations \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The course \n \nThe start and end point is docked at  Hart Station  in the  Bast  system. \n \nThe first part of the event is a short range scramble around some nearby high-tech stations. \nChoose any four of the following seven stations: \n \n \n Suri Park  in the Anlave System \n Kobayashi City  also in the Anlave System \n Chadwick Port  in the Gladutjin System  \n Aleksandrov Gateway  in the LHS 115 System:  \n Tanaka Terminal  in the LHS 2088 System:  \n Lacaille Prospect  in the LHS 3262 System \n Sy Base  also in the LHS 3262 System \n \n RETURN TO HART STATION  for a mandatory pit-stop prior to the second part of the race.  If you are running in the unlimited class you may now swap ships whilst docked at Hart Station if you like.  The clock won't stop though , so it's up to you. \n \nLaunch again from  Hart Station  and make the 124.86LY journey to the  Heike System  and dock at  Brunel City . Have a quick drink of refreshing Ceremonial Heike Tea if you like, but don't waste too much time - hit launch and get back to  Hart Station  to record your finishing time.  \n \n Classes \n \nThis race has two classes  \" Unlimited \"  and  \" Regulation Cobra \" . Anything goes in the unlimited class: Engineer mods, jumponium, whatever, you can even switch into a second longer ranged ship during the mid-race pit stop in Bast if you like. \n \nThere no  \" standard \"  class in this race, but special mention will be given to the fastest unmodified, no-jumponium entry. \n \nRegulation Cobra entries must use this build for the entire race:  https://coriolis.io/outfit/cobra_mk_iii/0petcFcldddsdf31717----36024900-2h.Iw1-kA==.Aw1-kA==?bn=Fat Tony's Hotrod Mk III  - Horizons players can remove their planetary approach suite if they prefer. Any disco scanner may be swapped for the BDS if you like. Note the half-sized fuel tank. \n \n How to Enter \n \nPlease let us know if you intend to take part, by posting in this thread with the following: \n \n Commander name \n Ship name(s) \n Ship type(s) \n Class (Regulation Cobra or Unlimited) \n \nBefore you start, take screenshots of the following: \n \n Outfitting screens for your ship (both ships if you wish to enter two ships in unlimited class), covering core internals (showing power plant, frame shift drive, thrusters and power distributor, along with jump range). If entering the Regulation Cobra class, please also provide screenshots of the optional internals. \n Launch screenshot, on the pad at Hart Station showing time and date. This is your  starting time , so hit launch and get racing! \n \nThe following additional screenshots are required during the race: \n \n A screenshot taken immediately after docking at each of your 4 chosen scramble-stage stations, this must show the station clock. \n A screenshot taken immediately after docking for the mandatory  \" pit-stop \"  at Hart Station in Bast, this must show the station clock and must be taken later than the scramble-stage shots and earlier than the visit to Heike. \n A screenshot taken immediately after docking at Brunel City in Heike, this must show the station clock. \n A final screenshot taken immediately after docking back at Hart Station,  this must show the station clock. This is your  finishing time .  \n \nOptionally you may also provide the following screenshots as entries in the Lonnegan Brothers' daring challenges (see below): \n \n A screenshot showing hull temperature and a visible hyperspace countdown timer, for entry into  Fat Tony's Barbeque Challenge . The cockpit clock must also be visible, and the displayed time must be within a submitted complete run. \n A screenshot showing ship speed during docking, for entry into  Little Nuk's Dangerous Landings Challenge .  The cockpit clock must also be visible, the displayed time must be within a submitted complete run and must be no more than 30 seconds prior to a successful docking screenshot. The station interior  must  be visible. The station exterior  must not  be visible. \n \nAfter the race, please send either a PM to  Raiko , or an email to  raiko  < at >  buckyballracing  < dot >  org  < dot >  uk , with the following: \n \n Your commander name \n Your forum user name (if different) \n Your ship name \n Your ship type \n Entry class (Regulation Cobra or Unlimited) \n Your total race time \n Your screenshots \n \nExamples of what your screenshots should look like can be found on the  How to Enter  page of the Buckyball Racing Club website. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Some obvious questions \n \n What's the prize? \n \nThe sight of your name at the top of the leaderboard, and the opportunity to say you won a Buckyball Race. And a little warm glow of satisfaction  \n \n What's to stop me cheating? \n \nNothing. Like the Buckyball Runs, we operate on an honour basis here. There's nothing I can do to stop you from faking screenshots or using exploits. But where's the benefit in that? It wouldn't get you anything, except a lasting feeling of shame. This is all about doing the race for the fun of it. \n \n Some not so obvious questions \n \n But what about the Bootlegger Challenge? \n \nDue to an unfortunate misunderstanding between the Lonnegan Brothers and customs officals at Weyl Gateway, Fat Tony and Little Nuk are currently spending a little time at the EDA-Penitentiary at Hughes Enterprise in the Kunti System. They are in negotiations with Warden Kittibomb to run the Bootlegger Challenge at a later date. \n \n So you mentioned some fun challenges from the Lonnegan Bros? \n \nYep I did. Fat Tony and Little Nuk remain massive fans of Buckyball Racing and watch every event from the comfort of their jail cell. They're joining us at this event via live-linkup and are running two challenges during the race for their own sick amusement: \n \n FAT TONY'S BARBEQUE CHALLENGE: \n \nFat Tony loves the smell of burning meat, so he's bringing the experience to your own cockpit with his Barbeque Challenge. The winner(s) of Fat Tony's Barbeque Challenge will be the CMDRs who attain the highest hull temperature during a hyperspace countdown during a completed Glorious Bast-erds racing run. See the  \" How to Enter \"  section above. This temperature should not result in ship destruction, but Fat Tony can't really verify that unless you upload a video of the full run, so he'll take your word for it. There will be a separate challenge winner for both unlimited and regulation cobra. \n \n LITTLE NUK'S DANGEROUS LANDINGS CHALLENGE \n \nLittle Nuk on the other hand loves to see things go boom - and not enough of that happened at the Bootlegger Challenge last year. So he's devised a cunning little challenge to encourage the occasional explosion. The Little Nuk's Dangerous Landings Challenge winner(s) will be the CMDRs who post the highest speeds inside the slot/docking bay prior to a successful landing. See the  \" How to Enter \"  section above. Again there will be a separate challenge winner for both unlimited and regulation cobra. \n \n Can I swap the weapons on my Regulation Cobra for something better? I love to pew-pew during races. \n \nNo sorry, Fat Tony used this exact build to claim 258 million credits in bounties pew-pewing elite FDLs in a Haz-RES. If it's good enough for Fat Tony, it's good enough for you. \n \nMind you, Tony's been in jail since before 2.1, so he might be in for a shock when he gets out. \n \n Raikogram of the Route \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nHeike isn't included in the Raikogram, as it's mandatory that you dock at Hart Station both before and after the visit to Brunel City.

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nJaques Station, the famous moving starport, has put out a call for supplies to help with repairs following the aborted jump to Beagle Point. This is no simple task, with a supply line stretching nearly 22,000 light years. Speed is of the essence to meet Jaques' demand in time to get the best rewards, so what better opportunity for a race? Buckyball Racing Club calls on all traders, haulers, explorers, racers and pilots everywhere to show what they can do, all in the aid of helping this far-flung outpost of humanity. \n \n Race Overview \n \nThe Long Haul is a race to support the community goal to repair Jaques Station, located nearly 22,000 light years from the human bubble in the system of Eol Prou RS-T d3-94. \n \nStart from  Janifer Dock  in  Yurok , carrying cargo suitable for the community goal. \nMake your way to  Jaques Station  in  Eol Prou RS-T d3-94  and deliver your cargo. \n \nThe clock starts on departure from Janifer Dock, and ends on arrival at Jaques Station, but breaks are allowed (up to two per day). \n \nYour actual travel time will be adjusted based upon your ship class and the amount of cargo delivered. The more cargo carried, the better. The time adjustment is weighted to even out the different ship classes, so a Type 9 has just as much chance of winning as an Asp Explorer or Anaconda. \n \nThe race will run from now until the end of 18th August. Participants must reach Jaques Station no later than 23:59:59 GMT (in-game time) on 18th August to be valid entries. The race will continue even though the community goal ended early. \n \n Warning : This is a long way: approximately 21,850 light years, and your ship will be weighted down by carrying cargo. The very fastest ships will require a good 9 hours flight time to complete the route; expect slower vessels to take substantially longer than that. Please ensure you allow sufficient time and make sure you take in appropriate food and water. Breaks are allowed in this race, so use them! \n \n Regulations \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The course \n \nThe start point is docked at Janifer Dock in the system of Yurok. \nThe end point is docked at Jaques Station in the system of Eol Prou RS-T d3-94. \nAny route may be taken between start and end. \n \n Cargo \n \nCargo must be carried, as the whole point is to support the community goal for delivering goods to Jaques Station, though I'm not actually going to enforce what cargo you carry. To contribute to the community goal you need to carry Power Generators, Tantalum, Structural Regulators, or Energy Grid Assemblies. Power Generators can be purchased at Janifer Dock; other items will need to be acquired elsewhere (then just call in at Janifer Dock on your way out of the bubble to start the race). \n \nTo even out the different ship classes, the actual time taken to complete the course will be adjusted according to the amount of cargo delivered to Jaques Station and a  \" base cargo allowance \"  for each ship type. \n \nAdjusted race time = (actual race time) * (base cargo allowance) / (actual cargo delivered) \n \nThus  the more cargo carried, the faster your adjusted time . \n \n (Note: potential rule change incoming, see post #156 below) \n \nThe base cargo allowance (BCA) for each ship type is shown in the following tables: \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n  \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nThere is no need to calculate your own adjusted time. Entries will just need to provide evidence of actual race time and actual cargo delivered, I'll calculate the adjusted times. \n \nNote that the measured cargo amount is the quantity  delivered  to Jaques Station. If you lose cargo along the way (e.g. to a cargo hatch malfunction), that will impact your recorded time! \n \n Classes \n \nEntries will be classified as either Standard class or Small Packet class, depending on the ship type used. This is just to reflect the fact that the smallest ships need to run shieldless to reasonably carry cargo, and needed a separate calibration of cargo allowances due to the low quantities carried. \n \nAs well as the classes from ship types, racers can choose to take part in either Classic or Unlimited classes. \n \nTo qualify as Classic, any entry must meet the following regulations: \n \n Engineer-modified modules are NOT permitted \n The use of FSD Injection is NOT allowed \n (Enhanced performance thrusters are allowed, as they should make neglibile difference given that there is only one undocking and docking on the course) \n \nUnlimited entries are those which don't meet the Classic regulations; thus any ship which has one or more engineer-modified modules, or makes use of FSD Injection at any point on the route, will be classified as Unlimited class. \n \n(I might introduce a separate Warship class, if there is demand for it) \n \n Breaks \n \nUnlike  The A* Challenge , for this race breaks are allowed, subject to the following rules: \n \nTo record a break, you will need to provide screenshots from the start and end of the break, with evidence of being in the same system at the start and end of the break time. This means taking screenshots from the galaxy map (or system map), as that is the only place which shows location, time and date in one go. \n \nNo more than 2 (two) breaks are allowed in any one day, measured as 00:00 GMT to 00:00 GMT (in-game time). \n\t\t \n\t \n \n How to Enter \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Please let us know if you intend to take part, by posting in this thread with the following: \n \n Commander name \n Ship name \n Ship type \n Class (Classic or Unlimited) \n \nBefore you start, take screenshots of the following: \n \n 1. Outfitting screens for your ship, covering core internals (showing power plant, frame shift drive, thrusters and power distributor, along with jump range). If entering the Classic class, please also provide screenshots of the optional internals. \n 2. Commodities market page at Janifer Dock to show the cargo carried. \n 3. Launch screenshot, on the pad at Janifer Dock showing time and date. \n Image 3 is your start time, so as soon as you've taken that screenshot launch and get going! \n \nDuring the race, for each break you take the following additional screenshots are needed: \n \n 4. Galaxy map showing your current location and the time and date at the start of the break. \n 5. Galaxy map showing your current location (must be the same system as when you started the break) plus time and date to end the break. \n \nAt the end of the race, take screenshots of the following: \n \n 6. End screenshot immediately on docking at Jaques Station, showing your current location (i.e. docked at Jaques Station!) plus time and date - this is when the clock stops. \n 7. Commodities market screenshot at Jaques Station, showing the commodities in your hold along with the location, time and date. The amount of cargo held at this point is what will be used to calculate your adjusted time; the screenshot must be within a reasonably short time of number 6. \n \nAfter the race, please send either a PM to  drakhyr , or an email to  drakhyr  < at >  buckyballracing  < dot >  org  < dot >  uk , with the following: \n \n Your commander name \n Your forum user name (if different) \n Your ship name \n Your ship type \n Entry class (Classic or Unlimited) \n Your screenshots (numbers 1 to 7 above) \n Any special conditions that apply to your entry* \n A quote for the guestbook on the bar at Jaques Station \n \n * Special conditions lease tell me about if: you used FSD injection at any point during the race; you made the trip in Solo Play or Private Group, rather than Open; you are playing on Xbox One; you are playing using Oculus (or other) VR; you made the run in a wing \n \nExamples of what your screenshots should look like can be found on the  How to Enter  page of the Buckyball Racing Club website. \n \nYou are then free to explore the area near Jaques; or, even better, to head back to the bubble for another run! Remember, the more cargo you ship, the better the result from the community goal! \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Some obvious questions \n \n What's the prize? \n \nThe sight of your name at the top of the leaderboard, and the opportunity to say you won a Buckyball Race. And a little warm glow of satisfaction  \n \n What's to stop me cheating? \n \nNothing. Like the Buckyball Runs, we operate on an honour basis here. There's nothing I can do to stop you from faking screenshots or using exploits. But where's the benefit in that? It wouldn't get you anything, except a lasting feeling of shame. This is all about doing the race for the fun of it. \n \n \n Leaderboards \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t

The enterprising ElectricZ is partnered with (or possibly works for?) a stoic kangaroo named Bucky. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n Some history from ElectricZ: \n \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The  \" Buckyball \"  Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash, widely known simply as The Buckyball Run, is an unofficial, unsanctioned spaceship race run from Xiaoguan Hub in Magec to the Vonarburg Co-Operative in the Wyrd system. The first run was not a real competitive race, as there was only one team running, but was intended both as a celebration of the Federation Interstellar Star Route System and a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. \n \nAs it was found out, the newly imposed 9.8c relativistic limit imposed by the Federation Maximum Velocity Law (imposed as an energy conservation measure) was actually slower than the quickest average velocities of point-to-point travels of Commander Ian Buchanan  \" Buckyball \"  Braben (no relation) in the first half of the 32nd century. In 3102, Braben flew the route in a Cowell-MgRath model 57 Sidewinder, averaging greater than 12.5c, setting a 32 minute record that stood for nearly 140 years. \n \nAnother motivation was the fun involved... \n\t\t \n\t \n To learn more about Bucky, please read  \" Behind the Ball \" . \n \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n The original use of the name  \" Buckyball \"  was as a nickname for mankind's first manufactured nanomaterial: buckminsterfullerene, so the shape of its molecule is used as the race's symbol. The name is an homage to Buckminster Fuller, and the geodesic domes of his invention. \n \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n Buckminsterfullerene is a carbon-60 (or C[SUB]60[/SUB]) molecule with atoms arranged in a truncated icosahedron that was originally described by Leonardo da Vinci. \n \nCMDR Jak thought it should be possible to find a race course that's shaped like a buckyball molecule. So numbers were crunched, the route modified (only slightly) to be more fun, and a course was plotted. Welcome to: The BuckyBubble. \n \n\t\t \n\t \n The BubckyBubble is not perfectly shaped like a C [SUB]60[/SUB]  molecule [SUB],[/SUB]  but it's accurate enough to be recognizable. A couple of systems were manually changed to avoid  very  long supercruise times. It's also small enough for most ships to navigate easily, but with 60 destinations it is most assuredly an endurance race. \n \n CLASSES \n 4 race classes are provided to allow for differing levels of race challenge and a variety of ships. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n Class Equipment Docking Time SC Stock \nChallenge Only  this shieldless  Hauler build . \n No  engineer modifications. \n No  FSD injection. \nPit crews with limpets are  not  allowed.

However all other classes require video submissions. \n \n I highly recommend using the free,  Open Broadcast Software project  for video capture and streaming. I didn't think that my machine could handle video capture while playing a game, and then this software was recommended by another Buckyball racer. It has saved me a ton of trouble during races. Thanks, robinjb. \n \n Please upload visual evidence to youtube.com, an imgur.com album, or another appropriate hosting service, and then include a link in in your submission. \n \n VERBOSE NETLOGS REQUIREMENT \n The use of verbose netLogs allows the race host to not check visual evidence in those systems where no docking takes place. By default, netLog files do not include the info needed to use them as evidence, so you will need to enable verbose logging. The process  was summarized in this post  by Executive Producer, Michael Brookes, but the detailed process is explained here. \n \n First, please review the following support article to identify the location of your game installation's AppConfig.xml file. \n https://support.frontier.co.uk/kb/faq.php?id=108 \n \n Next, create a file named AppConfigLocal.xml in that same folder, and open it with Notepad or another simple text editor. Copy/paste the following into the file, save it, and close the text editor. \n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n \n\t \n\t\tCode:\n\t \n\t \n\t\t [FONT=Verdana] < AppConfig > [/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]     < Network[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]        VerboseLogging= \" 1 \" > [/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]     < /Network > [/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana] < /AppConfig > [/FONT] \n\t \n Finally, use the support article above to find the location of your game installation's NetLog files. \n \n When you have completed a run of this race, please shut down the game client, and copy the most recent netLog.log file to include with your race submission. If you were disconnected one or more times during the run and still wish to submit it, include all relevant logs. \n\t\t \n\t \n RULES  &  PROCEDURES \n Make sure you are playing in open and park your ship at Lomas Orbiter, in the Wolf 359 system. Proceed as follows: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n Collect visual evidence of your ship's outfitting (see the official  How to Enter  instructions). \n Collect visual evidence of your start (see the official  How to Enter  instructions). \n Travel the route above (or your own route for the Funny Car class). \n Collect visual evidence at relevant spaceports along the way. \n Return to Lomas Orbiter, in the Wolf 359 system and collect visual evidence of your ship back on the pad. \n Log out of the game. \n For the Stock Challenge: \n Upload your screenshots to imgur.com or another appropriate hosting site. \n Video may be used, following the instructions for other classes. \n \n For other race classes: \n Upload your video to youtube.com or another appropriate hosting site. \n Create a list of video timestamps that show your ship docked at the required stations (see the official  How to Enter  instructions). \n \n Copy the netLog(s) containing your run to include with your visual evidence. \n Submit all visual evidence and other required info for your race entry via email to jhyrryl < at > buckyballracing < dot > org < dot > uk. \n \n\t\t \n\t \n DECLARING INTENT TO RACE \n Before racing, it is customary to declare your intent to race by posting in the thread, but it is not strictly necessary. To declare your intent, specify the following: \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t CMDR Name (forum alias) \n Ship Name  (ship type) \nRace Class ​ \n So my intent to race might look like: \nCMDR Seneh (Jhyrryl) \n Black  (Adder) \nStock Challenge ​ \n\t\t \n\t \n BEAUTY SHOTS \n The final podium update requires a beauty shot of your ship, if you take 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in any class. To take a beauty shot: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n drop out of supercruise next to a class F star in Solo; \n orient the ship so that the star fills the upper-left screen; \n open the classified camera (CTRL-ALT-SPACE by default); \n position the camera between the star and ship such that the ship fills 3/4 of the screen; \n take a screenshot; \n upload the screenshot to imgur.com or other appropriate hosting service; \n include a link to the shot with your submission \n \n\t\t \n\t \n SUBMITTING ENTRIES \n As noted in the Rules  &  Regulations section, evidence for your race entry (as described in the Evidence section) must be emailed. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Send entries to: \n jhyrryl{at}buckyballracing{dot}org{dot}uk ​ \n The email must include: \n \n \n your CMDR name and forums alias; \n the ship name and type used; \n the race class for this entry; \n the duration of your run, from start to finish; \n a netLog.log file attachment for your run; \n the platform on which you play (PC, XBox, Mac) \n a link to your visual evidence; \n if video is submitted, please also supply a list of timestamps showing your ship on the pad at each required station; \n evidence of your your ship's outfitting; \n whether or not FSD injection was used \n whether or not limpets were used to refuel \n if limpets were used, the names of your pit crew members \n a beauty shot of your ship \n \n\t\t \n\t \n FAQ \n \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Q:  What stations do I dock at? \n A:  In those systems where docking is required, you are free to pick any station of an appropriate type. \n \n Q:  So if a system with required docking has an outpost that is closer than a large starport, I can use the outpost? \n A:  If you are running in the Top Fuel or Funny Car classes, yes. The Pro class requires large starports for all docking. \n \n Q:  Why are we sending you our log files? \n A:  I have written a simple program to scan them for your arrival in a system, so you don't have to collect screenshots or video timestamps for systems that don't require docking. \n \n Q:  What if I'm playing on XBox and can't provide video or netLog files? \n A:  Then you'll need to do a little more work to provide all screenshot evidence.  Take a screenshot of the GalMap in every system where you do not need to dock, and use them for your visual evidence.  When uploaded, please, please make sure they are sorted in chronological order. \n \n Q:  What's the deal with limpet refueling? \n A:  There is a stretch of course where fuel management will be an issue for many ships trying to maximize their jump range. Limpet refueling can help mitigate that if you can find a friend to help out with your race attempts. Note that limpet refueling is not allowed for the Stock Challenge class. \n \n Q:  Can limpets be used anywhere else on the course? \n A:  Absolutely. \n \n Q:  Can I replace the Stock Hauler's Basic Discovery Scanner with an upgrade? \n A:  Yes, as long as it's another Discovery Scanner with the same mass.  You cannot replace it with a different type of equipment, even if it has the same or greater mass. \n \n Q:  Can I visit system other than those on the route? \n A:  Yes, otherwise it would be impossible for the Stock and Pro class ships to reach Ao from Wolf 359. \n \n Q:  Why are Funny Car Challenge ships capped at 27 LYs? \n A:  The 27 LY cap on jump range for  a full tank  is to encourage finding a more optimized route than the default route used by other classes, and/or require the use of FSD injection.  \n\t\t \n\t \n GOOD LUCK! \n Fly fast, CMDR! \n \n SUPPORT JAQUE! \n Can't participate because you're helping out Jaques Station?

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n \" In celebration of the 1333rd anniversary of the legendary first human landing on the Earth's Moon the historical reenactment society  \" Ex Luna Scientia \"  have partnered with the famous Buckyball Racing Club to organize a commemorative race, in the form of one their trademark  \" Midweek Madness \"  events. The race will be held from 19th through 21st of July starting from Lem Dock in the Chaac system, on a course including several systems with stations named after the crew of the historic  \" Apollo 11 \"  mission team. The finish line is Moon Prospect in the Turot system, where participants will be involved in surface racing with their rovers. Members of the  \" Ex Luna Scientia \"  group will entertain spectators reenacting sequences from that first Moon landing using exact replicas of the ships, space suits and primitive technology from the era. On static display at the intermediate race stages in the Faust 3566, Xevioso and Nyanmil systems will be replicas of several pre-FTL ships and technologies; including full-scale models of legendary 20th century vessels like the Saturn V rocket, the Apollo Command Module and Eagle Lander, Soyuz and Space Shuttles plus many others, courtesy of the society's vast collection. Hopefully racers won’t be distracted! \nThe race will be open to everyone, from regular  \" Buckyballers \"  to first-time racing pilots looking for some action. In this regard the race committee would like to suggest that due to the risks involved in this type of event all potential participants are strongly advised to provide full insurance coverage for their ships before entering the race. \" \n \n \nSo finally it's that time of the year again when systems all around celebrate one the first small steps of our spacefaring civilization. The show is starting, spectators are already arriving, the reenactors are preparing for their exhibitions, but most important of all, stations administrators have given their  \" go \"  for  \" Buckyballers docking  &  departing priority protocols \"  (a mostly polite way to say that additional traffic controllers, emergency teams and repairing crews are on the ready). Time to reach Chaac and get in your ships pilots! \n \n \n New to racing? \nPlease take a look to the following instructional video, courtesy of CMDR furrycat: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t [video=youtube;6Pk5rjMu11Q]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk5rjMu11Q[/video] \n \nEasy to learn, hard to master! \n\t\t \n\t \n \n \nRules are pretty straightforward this time: depart from Lem Dock in the Chaac system (either in a  \" Eagle Lander \"  or a ship of your choice, more on this below), touch  &  go at Collins Dock in Faust 3566, Armstrong Gateway in Xevioso, Aldrin Terminal in Nyanmil, exactly in this order, then finally point your ship to Moon Prospect on the surface of Turot 1A. Here there's a little twist: since the base administration is expecting a high volume of incoming traffic due to spectators arriving to attend the Moon landing reenactment by the Ex Luna society, a  \" race no-landing zone \"  extending for 10 km around the base has been authorized as a safety measure. \nFor this reason, pilots will have to land anywhere outside of this area and cover the last leg to Moon Prospect by SRV. A bit of buggyball has never hurt anyone (well, sort of).  \n \n \nOne last thing: a penalty mechanism will be present, officially to reassure stations administrators that the race committee discourage inconsiderate behaviours in proximity of their structures and historical vessels on display. You lose hull points, you add seconds on your final time, simple as that. \n \n \n RACE CLASSES, RULES AND REGULATIONS \n \nThe race runs from  Tuesday July 19th at 00:00:00 to Thursday July 21st at 23:59:59  (times are  server time ) .  All entries must start and end within this time period to be considered valid, but can be submitted until Friday July 22nd at 9:00:00 server time. \n \nOnly entries made in Open game mode will be considered valid. Entries made in Solo or Private will be counted as  \" Mission Simulations \"  and as such will be present in the leaderboard but won't be valid for final ranking. \n \nTwo ship classes are present for this race:  Open Unlimited  and  Eagle Lander . Participants can have entries in both classes, in case of multiple Open Unlimited entries only the fastest one will be accounted for. \n \nAs the name suggests, Open Unlimited accepts any ship able to land on small up to medium pads (Armstrong Gateway and Aldrin Terminal are outposts, sorry Orca and Annie flyers!). Any loadout, Engineer modifications, FSD injection, anything goes. Mind the restriction though, only ships able to land at outposts! \n \n \nFor the Eagle Lander class pilots will fly a Core Dynamics Eagle equipped with the following loadout: \n \nhttps://coriolis.io/outfit/eagle/0p3t5F5l3d5s8f2----2tv6--.Iw1-EA==.Aw1-EA==?bn=Eagle%20Lander  (yes, there are no shields, it's been done on purpose. Handle with care  ) \n \nOf course ship kits, paintjobs and any kind of ship decorations are allowed. \n(Note: Lem Dock doesn't provide all the equipment needed for the Eagle Lander, you may take a look at Ahern Enterprise in the nearby Tellus system, but only for outfitting, they don't sell Eagles there!) \n \n Race instructions \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Once you are ready in your ship docked at Lem Dock in the Chaac system, do as follows: \n \n- if you are flying in the Eagle Lander class, take a screenshot of the module panel of your ship (the panel should fit all the modules in view without need to scroll). Not needed for the Open Unlimited class. \n \n- take a screenshot of your ship on the pad at Lem Dock ready for take-off. The time shown will be the start time for your entry. \n \n- fly to Collins Dock in Faust 3566 and take a screenshot when landed (station interface and clock must be visible). \n \n- fly to Armstrong Gateway in Xevioso and take another screenshot there. \n \n- fly to Aldrin Terminal in Nyanmil and take another screenshot when landed (pay attention, Aldrin Terminal has  no  refueling facility! Make your calculations accordingly). \n \n- fly to Moon Prospect in Turot. Once there, you must land at no less than 10 km from the base, any point is good for landing until it's at least 10 km away. \n \n- take a screenshot of your landed ship, the clock, distance from Moon Prospect and remaining hull must be clearly visible. (this will count for the penalty time, see below) \n \n- get in your SRV and take a screenshot with your speed at 0 m/s with clock and distance from the base both clearly visible (the distance must be equal or bigger than 10 km, 9.99 won't make for a valid entry) \n \n- drive as fast as you can toward Moon Prospect, dock into an hangar there and take the final screenshot as soon as you are back again in your ship with the clock visible. The time shown will count as the finishing time for your entry. \n(should you find yourself in your ship hovering high above the base instead of docked at it, it's a known bug and won't compromise your entry. Just take the final screenshot as written above, the clock will still count for your final time) \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Penalty rule \n The remaining hull percentage after landing near Moon Prospect will count for the calculation of the final leaderboard time. Any hull point lost will add one penalty second to this time, so if a pilot makes a complete run (ship+SRV time) in 28:30 with ship hull at 67% after landing, a penalty time of 33 seconds will be added, for a calculated final time of 29:03. \nYes, the Eagle Lander has no shield. And you'll have to manage your fuel wisely. And you'll need to eyeball a good landing point at Moon Prospect. Nothing that hasn't been done already more than 1300 years ago. Have fun. \n \n \nHOW TO ENTER \n \nDeclare your intent to race by posting in this thread the following informations: \n \n- Cmdr name \n- Forum name (if different from cmdr name) \n- Ship Name \n- Ship type (if Open Unlimited) \n- Race class (Open Unlimited or Eagle Lander) \n- Game mode (Open, Solo or Private) \n- Your mission's motto (a very brief sentence in the style of the ones used in space missions more than a thousand years ago, anything like  \" Ex Luna, Scientia \" ,  \" Ex Tomato, Ketchup \"  ​or  \" Look ma, no hands! \"  will do) \n \nTo submit a run, send me via PM or email at  akenbosch  < at >  buckyballracing  < dot >  org  < dot >  uk  all the informations above, together with the following documentation: \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t - screenshot of the module panel of the ship (not required if racing in Open Unlimited class) \n- screenshot of the ship docked at Lem Dock (counts for starting time) \n- screenshot of the ship docked at Collins Dock \n- screenshot of the ship docked at Armstrong Gateway \n- screenshot of the ship docked at Aldrin Terminal \n- screenshot of the ship landed near Moon Prospect, with distance, clock and hull visible (hull counts for penalty time) \n- screenshot of the still SRV with distance and clock visible (counts for SRV starting time) \n- screenshot of the ship docked at Moon Prospect (or above it, counts for the finishing time) \n \nScreenshots can be taken in game using the F10 key (Steam users can also use F12), or captured from a complete video recording of the run. The latter mode is suggested if possible, to avoid missing to take some screenshots in the heat of the race. Uploading them to  http://imgur.com/]Imgur  is suggested for easier management, though any other similar service will be good too. \n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Beauty shot \n \n The top three competitors in each race class will be asked to provide a beauty shot of their ship, for awarding reasons. \n \nBeauty shots should be taken using the classified camera (Control-Alt-Space) and should clearly show your ship. The recommended way to take a beauty shot is to jump to a system with a bright star (eg F class star) and orientate your ship so that the star fills the top left quadrant of the screen. Then position the classified camera to show your ship illuminated by the light from the star. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nShip image and text courtesy of furrycat, again.

Entries made wholly or in part outside this period will be rejected.  All times are  server time . \n \nOnly entries made in  Open  mode will be eligible for classification.  Entries from Solo or Private Group mode will be added to the leaderboard as exhibition runs with their entry endorsed with an  x  notation.  They will not receive a final ranking. \n \nEntries may be made in  either  the  Open Unlimited  or  Regulation Eagle  class.  See  RACE CLASSES  below for more details on the classes.  Any  Open  mode entry not explicitly declared as being  Regulation Eagle  or not conforming to the build requirements for that class will be entered in  Open Unlimited . \n \nThe  start/finish  line for this race is  Lave Station  in  Lave . \n \nRacers must visit each of the five checkpoint stations in the order of their choosing.  Racers who submit multiple entries may, if they wish, choose a different sequence in subsequent entries. \n \n Visiting  a station means docking at any landing pad at the station, having first flown a loop around the front and back of the station, and providing valid evidence of having done so.  See  Station loop regulations  for more details on how to fly the loop.  See  HOW TO ENTER  for details on how to provide evidence of docking at each checkpoint. \n \nAfter visiting each station, racers must return to and dock at  Lave Station  to complete their entry. \n \nIt is  not  necessary to fly a loop around  Lave Station  before docking. \n \nFailure to visit enough checkpoint stations before returning to  Lave Station , or failure to return to  Lave Station  at all, will result in disqualification of the race entry.  Docking at a station without flying a loop will also be grounds for disqualification. \n \n [size=+1] Station loop regulations [/size] \nRacers must adhere to the following procedure for docking at each checkpoint station.  Where screenshots are required, they must show the HUD clock at the top-right of the screen  and  the time remaining on the ship's docking authorisation, or the station clock if docking has been completed. \n \nRequest docking  before  commencing the loop.  Each successive screenshot must show  less  time remaining on the docking authorisation.  [size=-2] Exceptions may be made for competitors who provide satisfactory evidence, for example a complete video recording, of cancelling and re-requesting docking permission while flying the loop. [/size] \n \nYou must start your loop from the  front  of the station.  If you dropped from supercruise without the atmosphere shield (the  \" mailslot \"  in pilot slang) visible you must first fly to the front of the station. \n \nTake a screenshot showing the atmosphere shield in front of you.  [size=-2] The screenshot does not have to be centred as long as it proves that you were in front of the station. [/size] \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nFly to the rear of the station.  [size=-2] Special note to Elite Racers: this part of the race is similar to a Zero Gravity event but you do  not  need to loop around the habitation ring. [/size] \n \nTake a screenshot showing the rearmost part of the station superstructure.  As with the first screenshot, it does  not  need to be centred as long as it shows that you reached the rear of the station. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nReturn directly to the front of the station. \n \nTake a screenshot showing either the atmosphere shield or the station interior.  You can take it before or after passing through the atmosphere shield as long as the station's interior lights are visible and you are  not  docked. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nTake a screenshot of your ship on the landing pad having completed docking. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n [size=+2] RACE CLASSES [/size] \nOnly entries made in Open play will be eligible for the race leaderboard. \n \n [size=+1] Open Unlimited [/size] \nThe  Open Unlimited  race class is open to all ship types and loadouts.  You can fly any ship you choose, outfitted how you choose.  Engineer modifications are allowed.  Frame shift drive injection is allowed.

The  deadline for submissions  is 09:00:00 server time on  Monday June 20th 3302 .  Entries received after that time will be rejected. \n \n \nEntries must include: \n \n Your CMDR name. \n Your forum name if not the same as your CMDR name. \n Your ship type. \n Your ship name. \n Game mode (Open, Solo, Private Group). \n Race class (Open Unlimited, Regulation Eagle). \n A screenshot of your modules panel showing the class and rating of all internal components, hardpoints and utility mounts installed.  [size=-2] Multiple screenshots should be provided if the UI needs to be scrolled to fit all modules in view. [/size] \n A screenshot of your ship on the pad at  Lave Station  showing the station clock.  The time shown will be your start time for the entry. \n Screenshots of your approach and landing at each of the five stations.  [size=-2] You need only submit a single screenshot of your ship on the pad at each station to qualify for a provisional place on the leaderboard.  The top three competitors in each class will be asked to provide further evidence as outlined in  Station loop regulations  above in order to secure a podium position. [/size] \n A screenshot of your ship on the pad at  Lave Station  showing the station clock.  The time shown will be your finish time for the entry. \n \n Beauty shot \nThe top three competitors in each race class will be asked to provide a  beauty shot  of their ship, which will be displayed for all to see at the end of the event. \n \nBeauty shots should be taken using the  classified camera  (Control-Alt-Space) and should clearly show your ship.  The recommended way to take a beauty shot is to jump to a system with a bright star (eg F class star) and orientate your ship so that the star fills the top left quadrant of the screen.  Then position the classified camera to show your ship illuminated by the light from the star . \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n Evidence \n All  entries must be accompanied by valid evidence. \n \nAcceptable evidence of completing the course includes screenshots or video of your run. \n \nExpand for full details on evidence required for this race, noting that more evidence is required than is usually the case for Buckyball races. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Screenshots may be taken using the in-game screenshot function (F10 key) or your choice of third-party software. \n \nYour video does not have to show the run in its entirety.  You may edit your video for time as long as it shows you launching from the start line and docking at  each  station, including loops. \nIf your video is not edited you are requested - but not required - to submit timestamps of the parts which show you docking so that the race organisers can quickly jump to the correct time to verify your run. \n \n Submitting evidence \nEvidence may be posted to  this thread , sent by forum private message to  furrycat  or emailed to  furrycat  < symbol: commercial at >  buckyballracing  < symbol: dot >  org  < symbol: dot >  uk . \n \nIf providing screenshot evidence by email you can attach screenshots to your email.  This forum no longer has support for attaching files to private messages. \n \nAlternatively you can create an archive (in, eg zip or rar format) and provide a link by private message or email to a website which hosts that archive.  If providing video evidence you should instead link to a publically-accessible video hosting site such as Youtube.  Entries will not be accepted if the race organisers cannot view your evidence.  The racer organisers  will not under any circumstances  create accounts on hosting platforms in order to view your evidence. \n \nEvidence posted to this thread should be in image album or video format only. \n \nEvidence in other formats may be accepted at the race organisers' discretion. \n \n Videos \nIt is highly recommended that you record a video of your  entire  race entry and capture individual frames of the video for use as screenshot evidence.  Doing so will free you from the pressure of having to remember to hit the screenshot key in the heat of the action, and will protect you from the momentary lag which can sometimes occur when taking high-resolution screenshots. \n \nFurthermore, recording the race will allow you to play back and analyse your entry to see where you can improve your time. \n \nThis forum has direct support for Youtube videos.  To post your video in this thread, use the [video=youtube] tag with your video's Youtube ID, for example  [video=youtube;6Pk5rjMu11Q]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk5rjMu11Q[/video] . \n \nYou are of course free to use a video host other than Youtube. \n \n Image albums \nThe preferred way to provide screenshot evidence is in an image album.  This forum has direct support for the  imgur  image hosting service. \n \nIf you have posted your screenshots (in chronological order) to imgur you can attach them inline by including the album URL in [imgur] tags, for example  [imgur]ttYOV[/imgur] . \n \nAlternatively, a direct link to the album's URL may be provided, eg  http://imgur.com/a/ttYOV . \n \nYou are of course free to use an image host other than imgur. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n [size=+2] SPECIAL NOTES [/size] \n Old World Hustle  is a crossover event designed to test some of the skills that members of the Buckyball Racing Club and Elite Racers do not generally use as part of their own races. \n \n [size=+1] Special note to Buckyballers [/size] \nElite Racers events test normal space flight skills.  You will be required to fly a loop around stations before coming in to dock rather than simply heading straight for the pad as you usually do.  Remember to complete the loop from the front to the rear and back to the front of the station. \n \n [size=+1] Special note to Elite Racers [/size] \nBuckyball races focus as much on route plotting and supercruise approaches as they do quick docking and undocking.  You will be required to choose a route between waypoints and cruise from the jump-in point as quickly as possible.  Decide on your route beforehand and remember to use the gravitational field of planets to slow down for dropout to normal space. \n \nAlso remember to fly straight round the station without completing a loop of the habitation ring, which is not necessary for this race. \n \n [size=+2] QUESTIONS [/size] \n So many screenshots! \nAll the screenshots are to prove that you correctly looped round the stations.  If you record a video of your entry you will be able to capture screenshots from the video later. \n \n What if I drop out of supercruise facing the rear of the station? \nYou will have to fly round to the front of the station before starting your loop, which means you will end up visiting the rear of the station twice.  Try to find a better supercruise approach so you drop facing the front of the station! \n \n Do I have to post an intent to race before competing? \nNot if you don't want to.  It's cool if you do, so other racers can look out for you on the course, but it's optional. \n \n Is frame shift drive injection synthesis allowed in this race? \nIt is in Open Unlimited.  Not in Regulation Eagle. \n \n Are Engineer modifications allowed in this race? \nThey are in Open Unlimited.  Not in Regulation Eagle. \n \n Am I allowed to fit my ship with... \nYes in Open Unlimited.  Anything goes with regard to outfitting.  To enter Regulation Eagle you must use the exact loadout specified. \n \n Where can I buy the components needed for the Regulation Eagle class? \nTry  Ridley Scott  in  Zaonce . \n \n Can I pimp my ride with ship kits? \nYes!  Spoilers, wings, tails, bumpers, bobbleheads and paintjobs of any colour are allowed in Open Unlimited and Regulation Eagle. \n \n Do I have to fit a shield? \nNo in Open Unlimited.  You can remove it to save mass and gain speed.   Yes in Regulation Eagle.   The shield generator is fitted in the  \" Optional internal \"  section of outfitting.  The shield itself is not optional. \n \n Why do I have to sell my Planetary Approach Suite? \nKeeping the suite will not be grounds for disqualification from the Regulation Eagle class.  You don't have to sell it but you are advised to do so regardless of the race class you are entering.  When approaching planetary bodies with the suite installed your ship will try to enter orbital cruise and perform an emergency stop if you are going too fast.  Removing the suite will allow you to fly closer to the planet's surface and slow down to drop out of supercruise at the station. \n \n I refuse to play in Open \nYou are welcome to run the course in Private Group or Solo mode and submit an entry.  Your attempt will appear on the leaderboard as an exhibition run and be excluded from ranking but you will still be able to compare your efforts to others'. \n \n But the Old Worlds are notorious for being home to characters of low moral fibre! \nThey certainly used to be.  If they still are, which some would argue is not the case, that just makes the race more interesting. \n \n Do I have to fly an Eagle? \nOnly if you are entering the Regulation Eagle class, in which case you must use the exact loadout described. \n \n Can I fly an Imperial Eagle? \nYes in Open Unlimited.  Not in Regulation Eagle. \n \n Why is it Regulation Eagle and not Regulation Sidewinder or Regulation Cobra? \nBecause the Elite Racers fly Eagles. \n \n \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nOnce again interest had picked up.  It had been over 4 human generations since anyone who really knew what was going on in Pareco had been alive.  Sure I had been manufactured back then... but my memories are not so good... someone's definitely been fiddling around there. \n \nI can remember deciding to move to Pareco, well I remember the decision being made for me at least.  Private detectives are not normally welcomed with open arms and cyborg ones even less so.  I found Pareco, a little backwater system with no planets, but there were stations and outposts there... orbiting... no, no just there.  I remember old Tom, I remember him being the only one who would answer any of my questions.  Folk told me to ignore him, said he'd taken too much Onionhead when he was younger and didn't know what he was talking about, I'm not so sure.  One night he came to see me, all excited about something and that's the last I remember.  3 maybe 4 days of black, Tom was nowhere to be found and no-one in any of the stations had heard of him.  I knew there and then to stop with the questions and just play blissful ignorance.  But things are changing. \n \nIn the last 18 months there's been a lot more pilots flying through Pareco, trade has picked up in the system and so has curiosity and now I have a new case.  I got contacted by Bucky, he wanted to make sure that his recently set up supply lines with two of the distilleries here would not have any problems with what may, or may not, be in this system.  I don't know who messed with my head the last time, but I know one thing for certain, I would take annoying them over Bucky any day. \n \nSo I need all the help I can get to see if we can find out what's going on in this system. Maybe you'll bump into something while flying between stations, or maybe you'll bump into someone in one of the bars. \n \n THE RACE HAS NOW ENDED \n \n The Race \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t If you've never been to Pareco before then you're in for a treat, it's one of those quirky systems that Elite throws up every now and then.  In fact when you're docked at one of the outposts you can see an Orbis station clearly in the distance.  I think in some cases the longest part of this race will actually be getting to the starting line    It's only 10k Ls so don't worry, though you really won't be able to tell what on Earth is going on until you get to within 0.5Ls then it will become apparent. \n \nThis one is more of a docking challenge than anything else, which fits in with the Midweek Madness theme, so grab you small speedy ships and get on the start line.  There are 4 stations and 2 outposts in the system, but what are they orbiting?!?  Pick any station or outpost that takes your fancy to start from and then visit every other one in any order you like.  You need to complete 2 laps (finishing at your starting position) and the second lap must be the same order as the first. \n \n Not challenging enough for you? \nThen try the Shieldless Stock Sidey challenge.  This is fairly straight forward, buy a Sidewinder (they sell them at the 4 stations), sell the shields and only the shields, try and complete the course  without  repairing.  This will be the last shieldless challenge before 1.6/2.1 raises the threshold on how much it takes to damage a ship on landing without shields (I'm not sure if that only applies to the initial threshold though) so it may be interesting to use as a comparison  \n\t\t \n\t \n \n How to Enter \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t State your intent to race, including: \n \n Your Cmdr name \n Your forum name if different \n Your ship type \n Your ship name \n Race type: Unlimited or SSS \n Once the race opens take a screenshot of your modules using the outfitting screen (for the last time  sniff )   Take a screenshot of the time before you launch and then one at each station/outpost as you dock.  You will have a total of 13 station shots as you will have 3 of your chosen start/finish point. \n \nIf you are doing the Shieldless Stock Sidey challenge then you will need an additional 2 photographs of the Station Services main menu before you start and after you finish, so that I can see your Credit amount and check you haven't repaired. \n \nOnce you have gotten all of your screenshots together and hopefully uploaded them to imgur (or similar) then send me a link in a PM. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Unlimited Leaderboard \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Shieldless Stock Sidey Leaderboard \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n \nThe doors to the bars are open, so break another rule.

Teams of three are invited to wing up and show their racing prowess in a relay race round a short lap. The course will take racers to the second star of each system; but don't worry, the longest supercruise distance is still less than 400 light-seconds. \n \n Overview \n \nThe start/finish line is at  Gardner Ring  in  Katukilal . The course runs from Gardner Ring to  Yu Orbital  in  Damnon , then  Silverberg Orbital  in  En Kungu , and back to Gardner Ring; or in reverse (Katukilal - >  En Kungu - >  Damnon - >  Katukilal). \n \nSecond Star Relay is a relay race for wings of three. Each member of the relay team in turn must complete a lap of the course, recording their times in the normal way (screenshots of start, finish and intermediate waypoints). The start time for racer 2 must not be earlier than the end time for racer 1; the start time for racer 3 must not be earlier than the end time for racer 2. Overall time recorded for the wing will be from the start of racer 1's lap to the end of racer 3's lap. \n \nIf you're having any trouble finding wingmates to form a team, the normal place to look is the bar nearest the finish line in Gardner Ring. Strike up a conversation in the bar (either here in this thread, or on the  Buckyball Racing Club Discord channel ) and you should find some wingmates. If that really doesn't work, drop the organiser a line (PM to  drakhyr  either here or on Discord, or email  drakhyr  < at >  buckyballracing  < dot >  org  < dot >  uk ) and I'll make sure to hook you up with some wingmates at a suitable time. \n \n \n Classes \n \nEntries will be accepted in two race classes: \n \n Open : Racing takes place in the main Elite Dangerous universe. FSD injection is NOT permitted. Enhanced thrusters and (engineer-)modified modules are not available. \n \n Beta Unlimited : Racing takes place in the Beta universe (2.1 / 1.6). FSD injection, enhanced thrusters and engineer-modified modules are all allowed.

Please note: To make the run a little more challenging, the fuel tank size has been reduced, so plot your course carefully, CMDR. \n \nIn the Open Unlimited Spec class the sky's the limit.

The beauty shots are to be taken as follows: \n \n1. Find a nice class F star in your vicinity and travel to it. Come to a complete stop as soon as you exit hyperspace and drop out of supercruise. \n2. Pitch and yaw your ship, so the center of the upper edge of the scanner is aligned with the lower right quadrant of the star, as shown in the picture. \n3.

If you think you've found a winning formula for a T9, go for it  \n \n \n Scoring and rules: \n \nAs in the old terrestrial internal combustion engine racing event called  \" Speedway \" , each racer has to participate in a number of  \" Heats \" , each consisting of 4 laps around the racing track outlined above. Each racer receives points according to what place they finished in. For example, if there are 4 racers in a heat, 1st place will be rewarded 3 points, 2nd 2 points and 3rd 1 point. Last place does not receive any points. \n \nThe number of heats will largely depend on how many people are signed up.  \n \nEach racer will have to run the same number of heats, so the scoring will be the same for all time zones. This also prohibits the same racer from participating in more than one timezone. You may register for all three timezones, but only run in one. \n  \nOnly exception: If you fail to complete the required number of heats because of unforeseen problems beyond your control, such as failing internet connection or server outages. All achieved points from previous races will be void. \n \nFailure to complete a heat due to ship destruction or module failure does not fall under the exception mentioned above and will be scored with zero points for that heat. \n \nCutting corners or flying above the course (over the plateau surrounding the course) will lead to disqualification, meaning a score of zero for that heat. \n \nAt the end of the racing event, the points for each racer will be summed up. Highest number of points wins. \n \nIn case of a tie in points, the racer with the fastest overall heat will win. \n \nThe race marshalls will perform video recording of each heat to determine heat times and to facilitate photo finishes, should the need arise. \n \n(Line up racers at the start line, start recording, change to galaxy map to determine time and start the race (3-2-1-GO). Exit GalMap and stop recording when last racer has crossed the finish line. Rename video file with TZ+heat#) \n \n How to participate: \n \nPlease post your intent to race in this thread, stating: \nCMDR name. \nForum name (if different from CMDR name). \nShip type. \nShip name. \nWhich time zone you'll be racing in (see above). \n \n \nIn order to lessen the wrath of the instancing gods, a private group has been set up for the event. Please apply to the  \" Stern Winter \"  private group well before the race. \n \nCMDR Samwell Drakhyr has very kindly set up a  Discord channel  for Buckyball Racing. \n \nBefore the race, please remember to turn off  \" Report crimes against me \" . A few bumps and scratches are to be expected. Noone needs fines or bounties on top of that. That being said, excessively violent flying and un-sportsman-like behaviour will be punished with disqualification at the race marshalls discretion. \n \nBennett Gateway (61.02LS, Starport) has a wide selection of ships and modules ","wordList":["the","buckyball","racing","club","is","proud","to","present","mid","week","madness","special","live","event","location","okinura","2a","12g","at","coordinates","-39","24","timetable","local","time","galactic","mean","europe","may","19","00","cest","17","gmt","americas","cdt","asia","pacific","aest","09","track","map","spoiler","walk-through","video","youtube","share","xhbfsgocr78","https","youtu","be","ships","there","are","no","restrictions","on","ship","types","or","loadout","if","you","think","ve","found","winning","formula","for","t9","go","it","scoring","and","rules","as","in","old","terrestrial","internal","combustion","engine","called","speedway","each","racer","has","participate","number","of","heats","consisting","laps","around","outlined","above","receives","points","according","what","place","they","finished","example","racers","heat","1st","will","rewarded","2nd","3rd","point","last","does","not","receive","any","largely","depend","how","many","people","signed","up","have","run","same","so","all","zones","this","also","prohibits","from","participating","more","than","one","timezone","register","three","timezones","but","only","exception","fail","complete","required","because","unforeseen","problems","beyond","your","control","such","failing","internet","connection","server","outages","achieved","previous","races","void","failure","due","destruction","module","fall","under","mentioned","scored","with","zero","that","cutting","corners","flying","course","over","plateau","surrounding","lead","disqualification","meaning","score","end","summed","highest","wins","case","tie","fastest","overall","win","race","marshalls","perform","recording","determine","times","facilitate","photo","finishes","should","need","arise","line","start","change","galaxy","3-2-1-go","exit","galmap","stop","when","crossed","finish","rename","file","tz","please","post","intent","thread","stating","cmdr","name","forum","different","type","which","zone","ll","see","order","lessen","wrath","instancing","gods","private","group","been","set","apply","stern","winter","well","before","samwell","drakhyr","very","kindly","discord","channel","remember","turn","off","report","crimes","against","me","few","bumps","scratches","expected","noone","needs","fines","bounties","top","being","said","excessively","violent","un-sportsman-like","behaviour","punished","discretion","bennett","gateway","61","02ls","starport","wide","selection","modules"]},{"name":"THE SWIFT-WALKER ECON SPRINT","author":"Seneh","date":"19.04.3302","dateDate":"3302-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","infoUrl":"https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/buckyball-racing-club-extended-mwm-the-swift-walker-econ-sprint-19th-25th-april.243523/","bannerImage":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614732620131205135/616641829806538752/swift-walker_banner.png","extractedInfo":"THE SWIFT-WALKER ECON SPRINT \n \n \n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n ​ \nAn easy-to-run, very fast race to keep racers occupied while waiting for the Kessel Run Episode II! \n \nStart at either station (see chart below) and navigate to the other using Economical Routes.

The pre-launch shot must show a full fuel tank and reservoir, and the refuel info in the post-landing shot will be used for any tie-breakers. \n \nSubmit all screenshots and other required info for your race attempt to this thread, via forum private message to Seneh, or emailed to jhyrryl  < symbol: commercial at >  buckyballracing  < symbol: dot >  org  < symbol: dot >  uk. \n \nIdeally, your screenshots will be collected into an Imgur album and appropriately sorted. If you record your attempt with video, please extract screenshots with readable timestamps from the recording. \n \nSubmitted evidence must include: \n \n \n Your CMDR name.   \n Your forum name if not the same as your CMDR name.   \n Your ship's name and type.   \n Game mode (Open, Solo, Private Group)   \n Pre-launch Station Services screenshot.   \n Race Start, Station Pad screenshot.   \n 2 System Waypoint screenshots.   \n Race End, Station Pad screenshot.   \n Post-landing, Station Services screenshot.   \n The time of your run.   \n All submitted runs must take place entirely during the days of 19 April 3302 through 25 April 3302. \n \n EDIT! : It appears that my econ route testing was insufficiently thorough.

One that I hope will test your skill in both the piloting of your chosen ship, and in the handling of your SRV. \n \nThis race starts from Schneider Relay in the Epsilon Indi system.

I won't spoil the surprise in case you haven't heard about this galactic wonder but suffice to say it's well worth a visit! \n \nOnce the race has started get your ship to Schneider Relay. Open the right-hand Status panel and take a screenshot that shows your current SRV distance travelled (you'll need to scroll to the bottom of the Statistics section to find this). When you're ready to go take another screenshot that clearly shows your start-time on the station clock, launch and fly to the first planetary base on your chosen route. Take a screenshot when you land (again showing the time), jump into your SRV, drive at least 5km away from the base and then recall your ship. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nTake a screenshot showing your ship either descending or landed on the surface next to you. \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nn.b. there  will  might be a daily award for best recall screenshot! \n\t\t \n\t \n Board your ship and then repeat the above process for each of the other three planetary bases. Finally fly back to Schneider Relay and take a screenshot showing your finish-time along with another screenshot of the status panel showing your new SRV distance travelled. This should be approx. 20Km (0.02Mm) more than your original distance but don't worry too much if it's not exact, it's just an extra verification of your run to support the set of screenshots. \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t BEFORE \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n AFTER \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Email your set of screenshots (there should be 12 in total) to   alec.turner@buckyballracing.org.uk  (I'd prefer it if you could upload  these to somewhere like imgur.com and then just send me a link to the album)  along with the following information: \n \n \n your commander name  \n your forum name (if different)  \n the type of your ship  \n the name of your ship  \n the  total elapsed time from start-time to finish-time (this  can be calculated by feeding the times shown on those two screenshots  into the following website:  http://www.timeanddate.com/date/timeduration.html# )  \n Submissions will be accepted from 00:00:00 (in-game time) on Saturday 2nd April 3302 until 23:59:59 on Sunday 17th April 3302. \nYou can make as many attempts as you like during this time. \n \n How long will it take? \n \nIt should take you around 45 minutes to complete this race. \n \n So what's the back story? Why are we doing this and what does it have to do with Total Recall. \n \nWell basically it's just an excuse for a bit of surf'n'turf Buckyball Racing. That said ... the Buckyball Racing Club has running costs (advertising, scoreboard maintenance, Bucky's pension fund, back-handers for local authorities to turn a blind eye, that kind of thing) and I've managed to secure a generous financial contribution from one of the largest manufacturers of SRV tyres in exchange for research data. You see it's come to their attention that SRVs don't leave any tracks! I know ... weird huh?

This is identical to how one might enter a race, as described in the  How to Enter section  of the official  Buckyball Racing Club website , even though this event is absolutely  *not*  a race.  \n Fill your cargo holds with Biowaste or Hydrogen Fuel  \" passengers \" .  \n Take a screenshot of the Commodities screen showing your cargo and CR balance.  \n Plan your route.  \n Take a screenshot of your ship's Modules tab to document the presence of a fuel scoop.  \n Take a screenshot of your ship in the launch position at Slackagers' Hangout.  \n Visit as many Tourism stations as possible before your Tour Time elapses.  \n Take an arrival screenshot on the pad at each station you visit.  \n Do not repair your ship or purchase fuel during the event; spending credits in any way disqualifies your certification attempt.  \n Visit as many stations as possible while there is still time available.  \n After the Tour Time for you class has elapsed, return to Slackagers' Hangout and take a screenshot on the pad to document your return time. \n Continue visiting stations as long as you have Tour Time remaining, even if your it will elapse before you can reach another station.  \n If you return to Slackagers' Hangout when there was still Tour Time available at the previous station, your certification attempt will be disqualified.   \n If you return to Slackagers' Hangout before the end of your Tour Time, your certification attempt will be disqualified.  \n    \n Also take a screenshot of the Commodities tab on your return to the Exigus system, documenting that you still have your passengers and that you have spent no credits during the tour.  \n To calculate your Certification Safety Rating: \n count the number of tourism stations visited;  \n in any system where you visited more than 1 station add +1 per station beyond the first (e.g., if you visit 2 stations in a single system, you get a +1 bonus; visiting 4 stations in a single systems grants a +3 bonus);  \n if not equipped with shields, subtract a penalty as indicated by your class;  \n multiplying the total by the number of tons of  \" passengers \"  carried;  \n then multiply the result by your remaining hull percentage.  \n    \n Also calculate a Tardiness Time: \n subtract your tour start time from your tour finish time to find your tour duration;  \n then subtract the Tour Time for your class from that;  \n For example, if you start a Cobra tour at 18:12:00 that ends at 19:03:41, your tour duration is 00:51:41, from which you subtract the 40 minute Tour Time for the Cobra, resulting in a Tardiness Time of 00:11:41.  \n    \n If for any reason you and your passengers must use escape pods to abandon your ship (for example, because of pirate attack), immediately report the number of passengers requiring rescue in this thread.  \n Submit screenshots and other required info for your certification attempt to  this thread , via forum private message to S eneh,  or emailed to  jhyrryl  < symbol: commercial at >  buckyballracing  < symbol: dot >  org  < symbol: dot >  uk . \n Ideally, your screenshots will be collected into an Imgur album and appropriately sorted.  \n If you record your attempt with video, please extract screenshots with readable timestamps from the recording.  \n    \n Submitted evidence must include: \n Your CMDR name.  \n Your forum name if not the same as your CMDR name.  \n The certification class of your attempt.  \n Your ship's name.  \n Game mode (Open, Solo, Private Group)  \n All of the screenshots indicated above.  \n Whether or not FSD Injection was used.  \n Whether or not you incurred a missing shields penalty.  \n Number of Passengers carried.  \n Total stations visited.  \n Total bonus for secondary stations.  \n Final hull percentage.  \n Your calculated Certification Safety Rating.  \n Your calculated Tardiness Time.  \n    \n Attempts cannot begin prior to 18 March 3302, nor end later than 26 March 3302.  \n \n\t\t \n\t \n CERTIFICATION CLASSES \n There are 8 non-faction ships suited to chauffeur work, but 2 are not available due to contractual limitations. Safety ratings for each certification will be calculated independently, as each certification requires touring for a different minimum time frame. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n Certification \nClass Ship \nType Tour Time \n(minutes) No Shields \nPenalty Road Trip Sidewinder 20 -1 Taxi Driver Adder 30 -1 Rideshare Cobra Mk.

Do they still count? \n A:  No. These systems have planetary tourism sites that are not yet implemented. It is recommended that you scout out any such systems ahead of time, but here are details for some of the relevant systems within 75 LYs of Exigus. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Q: What about systems that only have Outposts, preventing the Yacht and Party Barge classes from landing? \n A:  If you can't land at a station, you can't improve your score from visiting it. Here's a list of relevant systems, which may include systems with both outposts and larger stations. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\t\t \n\t \n Q: Does a system with two Tourism stations count double? \n A:  Not quite. Scoring is for total stations visited, not systems. But there is a bonus for visiting multiple stations within a single system. \n \n Q: Why are fuel scoops required? \n A:  Because it's an exciting, but very safe aspect of racing that we can use to promote racing to our passengers! \n \n Q: What if there's a tie? \n A:  This isn't a race, but it's worth noting that a prospective employer who is evaluating which of two pilots to hire, who happen to have the same Safety Certification Score, is likely to pick the one with the lowest Tardiness Time. \n \n Q: What if it's still a tie? \n A:  There are no ties when there isn't a competition! \n \n Q: Can I use FSD Injections? \n A:  Yes. \n \n Q: Isn't that unfair? \n A:  To whom? This is not a race! \n \n Q: Imperial ships are sleek, why can't they be used for this? \n A:  Imperial vessels typically win racing event, and we do not want to confuse people into thinking that this event is a race. \n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We also don't want the passengers scared into thinking they might end up as slaves. \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\t\t \n\t \n AWARDED  &

of 1 minute per repair  \nthis is to give a slight advantage to racers who make the run without repair. whilst acknowlaging it can be dangerous to drive quickly for 30minutes. \nthe organiser cannot be held responsible for any pychos trying to blow you or ship up in open, it will be safer to run in solo or in a group.  \nfeel free to organise a time for you and other CMDR's to race togeahter. \nit should be noted that landing pads are start/ finish locations for drivers consequently there is no one start / finish line.  \ntake note of the pad sizes and locations and plan your runs accordingly. Make sure you have the correct base selected before requesting docking permission as you drive towards it. \ndecent open source, relatively unobtrusive vid cap software can be found here ( https://obsproject.com ) \nThere will be a leader board and the winner will be the fastest verified time at the end of the race on the 26th \n  \n F.A.Q \n \n  -What do i need? \n Horizons, An SRV (buggy) ,video capture software for competative entrants \n 45 mins ish to get to wasat and do a run \n \n  -What's the BRC? is it like the RAC?, will you come and tow me?  \nno, sry.. the BRC is the buckyball racing club, we do rally style races in ships normally. but this is the first buggy ball race of hopefully more to come. \n \n  -I don't have screen capture software, can i enter? \n sure you can just enter for fun,  but competative times will need to be verified by uploading a video somewhere. \n try OBS ( https://obsproject.com ) which is open source and should do a basic job for evidence purposes. \n \n  -When is the race on?  \nRACE TIME BETWEEN 00:00 23rd FEB to 23.59 25th FEB \n you can enter any number of attempts during the 48hrs the event is held.  \n \n  -What do i do? \n post your intent to race in this thread to get on the starting grid. \n USER NAME \n CMDR NAME \n BUGGY NAME \nIf you haven't worked it out yet.. buckyball's are time trail races.. the buggyball is no different. the fastest timed run over the duration of the event wins. \n land your buggy equiped ship at either ports landing pads. start your video capture recording and take a screenshot of the time on the dash \n then deploy your buggy and race like the clappers to the other port. remembering to ask for docking permission when you are within 7.5km , \n find your pad, return to the ship and take the final screenshot of the time on the dash. stop your vid cap recording and check your time. \n congratulations you are a buggyballer!  \n send the 2 screenshots to the BRCWUR email address above.  \n be ready to upload the video of your run should you have a winning time for checking. \n if you get a podium position please send a selfy of you in your buggy. \n \n -How long is it between the 2 bases? \n the course is about 50km and should take you between 25-35 minutes.. you may blow up and be sent to Behring point. in which case it will take you longer.  \n \n  -Can i race in a wing? \nBy all means it will make your run more enjoyable, as long as you record the run and take the correct screenshots at the start finish of the time your run is valid. \n \n  -Can i use repair synthesis? \n Yes but they incur a 1 min time penalty \n \n  -How will you know if ive repaired? \n I wont but if you win and your video evidence shows you using repair you will incur the penalty and the wrath of of bucky.  \n \n -Hold on a minute.. why isnt there a start / finish line and you take times from a vidcap timestamp. \nThats all a bit too complicated.. buckyball runs rely on screenshots to varify location at a time where the clock is viewable on the HUD because for this race.. itd be easy to fly from start to finish and post a time you are required to have videod your run for the purposes of validating the submitted times. \n\t\t \n\t \n Start your engines and good luck to all. \n \nEDIT:- buggyball 1  over, thanks to all those that competed. here's a pic of the

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \nFriedrich Peters Ring is the home of Arthur Friedrich Peters, a retired engineer who spent his formative years mining and trading metals; thanks to a few well-hidden asteroid belts and the various rushes for precious metals over the decades, he made enough to afford his own starport. Of course if you ask him, he'll also claim that he designed the station himself; most patrons are wise enough not to point out its striking similarity to all the other Orbis starports across the bubble. \n \nOne thing that Art does enjoy is a good race, and he's decided it's long past due that he took the time to host one. So pull up a seat, sit back and watch the fastest and craziest pilots around give it their best shot. But don't sit on the sidelines for too long - everyone's expected to cause at least a  bit  of pandemonium... \n \n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n ​ \n \n Race Classes and Rules \n \n \n The Short Circuit  (Open Unlimited / Open Sidewinder) \n The Black Sheep  (Open Unlimited) \n The Token Ring  (Open Unlimited) \n All classes are to be run in  Open Play  for this race (apologies to the Solo folk, but I didn't fancy an explosion of leaderboards!) \nHorizons is not required for this race, which means no use of FSD Boost. \nIn-flight repairs are allowed, although Delia Grind may be very disappointed in you if you choose to do so. \nThe race runs until  2359 GMT  on  Saturday 23 January 3302 ; entries must have a start time before midnight on the 24th to count. \n \n \n The Short Circuit \n \nA few of the more eccentric station administrators not far from Pandemonium have started some malicious rumours that Friedrich Peters Ring is in disrepair; blades missing off fans, exterior lights blinking, that sort of thing. Art thinks they're insecure about how silly the names of their starports are. Either way, he's having none of it - pay them a visit, and remind the locals that Art's no pushover. Rude gestures while passing docking towers are optional but encouraged. \n \n Route (visit in the specified order, in either direction) : \n \n Pandemonium - Friedrich Peters Ring \n Kutjalangai - Chretien Oudemans City \n Jotunheim - Big Harry's Monkey Hangout \n Futhorc - Acquired Taste Orbital \n Epsilon Hydri - Radian V \n Cardea - Tygerlily-Merlyn Pleasuredome \n Flesk - Glen's house of Lambada \n Pandemonium - Friedrich Peters Ring \n The Sidewinder Challenge \nThere's extra kudos for the fastest pilot to run the route in a Sidewinder of Art's outfitting. We explained to him about how using D-rated components made the ship lighter for better jumping and an A-rated FSD would help it go faster; we think he might have got a few wires crossed given the result, but hey - it's his race! \n \nThe Regulation Sidewinder looks like  this  - take a stock Sidewinder, remove the guns and empty out the internal compartments (no shields, cargo or scanners). Then upgrade the thrusters and power distributor to A rating, and the FSD to D rating. \n \n Note:  The hop between Epsilon Hydri and Cardea appears to confuse the in-game route planner terribly. It  is  possible to do this hop in two jumps via Vistaenis with a full fuel tank, not the 5 jumps (requiring a fuel stop) the in-game planner tries to send you round the houses with. Curse you ship computer! Normally I'd let racers figure this out, but this is a pretty massive difference caused by (basically) a game bug, so just this once you get a free pass. Don't get used to it! \n \n Q:  Haven't we had a few of these circuit races recently? Running around just to end up where you started? \n A:  Alright, no need to rub it in! Fortunately, Art has you covered. In case you hadn't noticed yet, it turns out he's not the most mature of folks... \n \n \n The Black Sheep \n \nArt's got some good-for-nothing distant relative of his who hangs out over in the VESPER-M4 system; in his own words,  \" Rose Angler, or something like that. \"  Anyway, he wants you to head over there (via some other sensibly-named starports, of course) and leave her a taunting message about her trading prowess. Fastest one there gets free drinks for life back at Friedrich Peters Ring. Everyone else at least gets a round... \n \n Route (visit in the order specified) : \n \n Pandemonium - Friedrich Peters Ring \n Gliese 105.2 - Fokker Dock \n Eurybia - Awyra Flirble \n Eurybia - Chris  &  Silvia's Paradise Hideout \n Decima - Gustypants Outback Emporium \n Ursitoare - Lucy Young's Orbital Happy Home \n Forculus - Irrational Exuberance \n VESPER-M4 - Slough Orbital \n \n The Token Ring \n \nNow the more crazy among you might be thinking this all sounds far too easy; you remember Mrs Lonnegan's Ultimate Spa Weekend Trophy, that was a real challenge! Well, Art hears you. He's hand-picked a few of the most far-flung rings he can find to keep you busy; visit them in any order you like, and return to Pandemonium to complete the race. Best of luck! \n \nStart/Finish: \n \n Pandemonium - Friedrich Peters Ring \n Starports (visit in any order) : \n \n Chac Cimih - Busch Ring \n Evejitaka - Love Ring \n HIP 296 - the only  \" Ring \"  in this system ( apparently  the name is too risque for the forums!) \n Isitani - Creamer Ring \n Katosus - Shatner Ring \n Na Zha - Rose Ring \n Pictavul - Airy Ring \n There is no bonus of any sort for running this in a Sidewinder. Nothing. Na da. Why are three of you already running off towards the shipyard... Dammit, not again. \n \n \n How to Enter \n \n \n First up: state your intent to race in this thread! It should include your  CMDR name , the  ship's name and type , which  race class  you're planning to enter, and your  favourite system name  in the game. \nIf you aren't signed up on the forums, you can also email this information to the address further down. \n Next, haul yourself over to  Friedrich Peters Ring  in  Pandemonium  and head into the hangar. \n Get your outfitting how you want it, and take a screenshot showing your internal compartments and jump range. Then, use the Return To Surface button to get ready to race! \n Once you're ready to go, take a screenshot (by pressing F10, or F12 to use Steam screenshots) showing the current date/time, and the station. \n Go buzz some towers! Take screenshots at every checkpoint along the way (showing the date/time and station, just like the start line) and at the finish line. \n Upload your screenshots to a free hosting service such as  imgur  (feel free to convert them to JPEG first for faster uploading). \n Send the following information to me, either by email to  alot  < at >  buckyballracing  < dot >  org  < dot >  uk  or alternatively by forum PM to  Esvandiary : \n Commander name and forum username \n Ship name and type \n Race class you've entered \n Links to your screenshots/video: must show outfitting, start, every checkpoint and finish \n \n \nPlease don't post your times in the thread before the last day; when dealing with racers it's not a good idea to give them a target! \nIf you're unsure of what screenshots to take, have a look at  this guide  on the BRC website. \nNote that a full run video is fine for evidence, but grabbing screenshots from the video would be appreciated to help me keep track of everything. \n \n \n FAQ \n \n Q:  What's the prize for winning? \n A:  A warm, fuzzy feeling of pride. Otherwise known as nothing whatsoever. \n \n Q:  What's all this about no FSD boosting? Do you hate speed or something?! \n A:  Since materials are currently only attainable on planets, this would effectively be handing a free advantage to Horizons owners - and this ain't that kind of race. \n \n Q:  Pandemonium? Don't you mean 'Pandamonium'? \n A:  The system was renamed after the  great Winged Panda invasion  of March 3301. Never forget. \n \nNow, get out there and get racing!

\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nFor the last several months, gossip in the high society of Windt Terminal has focussed around the dashing figure of Anders Yemantov, commercial head of BrightLeaf Holdings plc, second son of Baroness Jamelka Yermantov, and the most eligible bachelor for three systems. Despite the attentions of many of the area's greatest beauties, Anders has managed to be unfailingly charming, but resolute in not attaching himself to any of them. \n \nNow Deanna Heath, heir to the Heath family fortune and rumoured to be the brains behind many of the family firm's most profitable new products, has taken an interest. Her pursuit of Anders' attentions has led to an escalating gift war as she seeks to prove her culture, brains and wealth. This challenge has now spread beyond the system, as she's issued a very particular shopping list. To aid in the speed of supply, this is where Deanna has requested the aid of the Buckyball Racing Club. \n \nBuckyball Racing Club presents My True Love Sent To Me, a race to get the right collection of rare goods back to Windt Terminal in time for an amazing party early in the new year. \n \n The Race \n \nThe race starts and finishes at Windt Terminal in the  Q1 Eridani  system. \n \nThe race is then to purchase, and return to Windt Terminal with, the following: \n \n 12 x Karsuki Locusts (from West Market,  Karsuki Ti ) \n 11 x Nguna Modern Antiques (from Biggle Hub,  Nguna ) \n 10 x Tauri Chimes (from Porta,  39 Tauri ) \n 9 x Eden Apples of Aerial (from Andrade Legacy,  Aerial ) \n 8 x Damna Caparaces (from Nemere Market,  Damna ) \n 7 x Arouca Conventual Sweets (from Shipton Orbital,  Arouca ) \n 6 x Rapa Bao Snake Skins (from Flagg Gateway,  Rapa Bao ) \n 5 x Momus Bog Spaniel (from Tartarus Point,  Momus Reach ) \n 4 x Ethgreze Tea Buds (from Bloch Station,  Ethgreze ) \n 3 x Helvetitj Pearls (from Friend Orbital,  Helvetitj ) \n 2 x Giant Verrix (from Greeboski's Outpost,  Phiagre ) \n 1 x Kinago Violin (from Fozard Ring,  Kinago ) \n \nThe race starts at 00:00 GMT on 25 December 3301, and finishes at 23:59 GMT on 6 January 3302. Entries can be made in any ship, at any time during that window, but you must cross the finish line by 23:59:59 on 6 January for your entry to count. \n \n The Rules \n \nThe list above adds up to 78 tonnes of goods to collect, meaning that ships with fewer than 78 tonnes of cargo capacity will have to make multiple returns to Windt Terminal. Race entries will thus be split into four classes according to the cargo capacity of your vessel: \n \n Albatross class: cargo capacity 78 tonnes plus \n Buzzard class: cargo capacity 40-76 tonnes \n Falcon class: cargo capacity 20-38 tonnes \n Wren class: cargo capacity  < 20 tonnes \n \nI realise there will be a small amount of luck here around spawns of the rare goods at each station. While the items you have to collect more of are those with the higher allocations, the allocations only go up to 18 tonnes, so plan your route around the fact that you might have to wait (or return) for more of some items. \n \nAll of the rare goods in this event should be legal everywhere. \n \nAs normal, screenshots will be required as proof of your race. Screenshots will be required for the following (see the  How to Enter  page of the Buckyball Racing Club website for examples of what the screenshots should look like and show): \n \n Outfitting (key here is to show your cargo capacity as that determines your entry class) \n Launch from Windt Terminal \n A screenshot at each waypoint showing the purchase of the required goods (this can just be done with a single screenshot of the commodities screen immediately after purchase, as it shows time, location and the quantity in your hold) \n If you return to Windt Terminal for intermediate stops, screenshots showing you there with the goods from that leg (i.e. commodities screenshot showing all the items you brought back this time) - but see note below on breaks \n Touchdown at Windt Terminal at the end of your run (you do also need to submit the commodities screenshot showing that the right items have been brought back to Windt Terminal, but the clock stops when you dock rather than when you finish selling items) \n \nIf you are recording your race on video, I recommend still taking screenshots at the start and finish to clearly show the start and end times. Otherwise, a video recording can take the place of all the intermediate screenshots. \n \nAs this is a long race, breaks are allowed under certain circumstances. The rules on breaks are: \n \n Breaks can be taken at the start/finish line (Windt Terminal) or any of the waypoint stations. \n Any number of breaks can be taken at Windt Terminal, but no more than six (6) breaks in total can be taken at other stations. \n If taking a break, in addition to the normal commodities page screenshot, you should also take screenshots on landing (when the clock will stop - like a normal race end) and on departure (when the clock starts again - like a normal race start). \n An additional  35  seconds will be added to your time for each break - this is to make up for the time you would normally take having the landing pad turn round, selling items, refuelling, etc. \n \nFSD Injection is not allowed. \n \n \n How to Enter \n \n \n Get to Windt Terminal in the system of Q1 Eridani.

This is the fourth week-long warm-up race, designed to be a short diversion from everyday trucking, hunting and exploring. \n \nI'll be hosting the event from the cockpit of my faithful T6, although you will have to excuse any delay with the comms as I am currently somewhere in the core, heading away from Weyl Gateway as fast as I can. It turns out Fat Tony doesn't have a sense of humour - who knew I was only to deliver the products in the  Bootlegger Challenge , not actually use them at the spa with Mrs Lonnegan? I am not sure if it was drinking all the Mega Gin or giving Carmela a sensual massage with Herculis Body Rub that tipped him over the edge...so I thought it would be a good time to see the rest of the galaxy. \n \nAnyway, the race was inspired by a visit to the Rat Cave - home of the  Fuel Rats . Those of you who like a bit of back story, read away, otherwise skip straight into the details of the race. \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I sat down at a table in a dark corner, towards the back and overlooking most of the Rat Cave. \n  \n \" Hey Rusti, long time no see. \" \n  \nI turned to the sound of the voice and noticed that I wasn't alone at my table - there was a figure sat in the deepest shadow, keeping a watchful eye on the rats in the cave. \n  \n \" Hey SB! Just the Rat I wanted to see. \" \n  \n \" What’s up? \"  the dark figure replied. \n  \n \" I am heading out on a long journey, so won't be doing many rescues until I am back. Actually, I won't be taking any limpets as I want to keep the weight down to maximise my jump range. I'll make sure I keep connected to the mischief through ship comms, just won't be firing any limpets for a while. \" \n  \nSurly Badger nodded, the movement barely visible in the shadows. \n  \n \" No problem Rusti, we have plenty of young, keen Rats to keep the limpets flowing. In fact, I overheard a couple of them talking when I came in \" , Surly chuckled and continued  \" They were arguing if you could fly across the width of the galaxy without a fuel scoop. \" \n  \nI snorted  \" The width of the galaxy...as in 80,000 Light years? \" \n  \n \" Yeah, I don't think they have been out much. I think they meant the bubble, one side of populated space to the other. What is it? About 400 Light Years? \" \n  \n \" Something like that. And it would be easy nowadays with extra fuel tanks and stuff. \" \n  \nSurly Badger sighed  \" I guess it would be. \" \n  \n \" Anyway, I need to find Orange Sheets to let him know I'll be absent for a while and then I want to get going. Laters SB. \" \n  \n \" Fly safe Commander. \" \n  \nI got up and headed through the cave to the front, passing Alec the holographic bar tender serving strong coffee to the Rat in the dispatch chair. Looking up I saw it was DerryBear, running dispatch on several rescues at once. \n  \n \" Hey Uncle Rusti! How’s the rocking chair? \" \n  \nI smiled and replied  \" Gonna need someone to keep it warm. I’m heading out on a walkabout. \" \n  \n \" Well take some limpets and drop them at stations out near the edge of the bubble on your way out. I've been getting reports that there has been a shortage out in the frontier systems \" \n  \nNodding I said  \" I'll see what I can do. See you later Derry. \" \n  \nA little later I was sat in the cockpit of my Lakon Type 6 Exploration ship, waiting for the docking clamps to release so I could start my journey. I decided to make one last call before I left. \n  \n \" Hey Drakhyr! I have an idea for a race... \" \n\t\t \n\t \n   \nThe basic principle is to fly as fast as you can from one side of populated space to the other, paying a visit to the Fuel Rat’s home system of Fuelum and the systems that see the most rescues. About 400 Light Years. Sounds easy doesn't it? \n \n There are a couple of catches . \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n No Fuel Scoop. \n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n No extra fuel tanks. ​ \n\t\t \n\t \n This means that you may need to find a fuel source as you make this journey across the bubble. There are plenty of outposts, stations and, of course, Fuel Rats that could help you out. \n \nThe route is reversible, so you can start at either  Hooke Hub  in  Tepech  or  Ocampo Station  in  Mirateje  but you must always visit  Wollheim Vision  in  Fuelum  (official home of the Fuel Rats),  NLTT 48288  (most popular place in the galaxy to run out of fuel) and  MCC 811  (second most likely place to run out of fuel). You finish at either  Tepech  or  Mirateje , depending where you started. \n \n Bonus Snickers \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t Fuel Rats love Snickers, almost as much as they love Limpets. So for an extra challenge, why not deliver some Limpets to Mirateje? This will require you to  start  at  Hooke Hub  in  Tepech  and  collect a fixed number of Limpets  (see tables below) from Wollheim Vision and deliver them to  Ocampo Station  in  Mirateje . Bonus Snickers are not eligible when starting from Mirateje and entering the Bonus Snickers is optional. \n \n Ship Classes \nThe distances between the race checkpoints means that the ships split into two classes –  Fuel Rat Regulars  that can make  most  of the distances without needing extra fuel and  Fuel Rat Crazies  that will need to make additional stops for fuel (ideal if you feel the need to dent more stations or receive more limpets). \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n Note that the Asp and Diamondback Explorers have reduced fuel tanks from a standard build! \n \nLeaderboard \nThere will be one leaderboard during the race, but three sets of podiums at the end – Fuel Rat Regulars, Fuel Rat Crazies and Bonus Snickers. There may be a special mention for the Commander delivering the most Limpets during the course of the week…if anyone delivers any at all! \n \n How to enter \n1.    Get to Hooke Hub in Tepech or Ocampo Station in Mirateje. Make repairs, fill with fuel, and ensure your ship is outfitted exactly how you want it for the race. \n2.    Open the Outfitting screen and capture a screenshot (F10) of your ship. Be sure to capture Power Plant, Thrusters, Frame Shift Drive and Power Distributor statistics as well as your ship's mass. \n3.    Return to the surface and prepare for launch. \n4.    Hit F10 to take another screenshot, or start your video capture, showing your start location and time. \n5.    Call at the following systems, in any order. At each one, take a screenshot on the landing pad (Wollheim Vision) or the Galaxy Map (NLTT 48288 and MCC 811). \n \n \n Wollheim Vision in Fuelum \n NLTT 48288 \n MCC 811 \n   \nNOTE: if doing a Bonus Snickers run you will need to take an extra screenshot of your Cargo screen (from the right panel) when you have purchased limpets in Wollheim Vision) \n  \n6.    Get to your finish station (Hooke Hub or Ocampo Station), taking another screenshot on arrival. \n7.    Send a PM to me ( mw_aurora ), or email  rusticolus   < at >  buckyballracing  < dot >  org  < dot >  uk , with the following: \n \n \n Forum user name \n Commander name (i.e. your in-game name) \n Ship name \n Ship type \n Race entry class (open play, solo or private group) \n Bonus Snickers Entry (Yes/No) \n Refuel method (Station or Limpets) \n Race time \n Either a link to your video, or a link to your screenshots.

00:01 on 5th December and finishes 23:59 on 13th December. \n Fastest time wins. \n You can enter with multiple ship classes. \n Sorry, what happens in Beta stays in Beta - entries must be in the released version. \n No Fuel Scoops are allowed. \n Do not exceed the maximum amount of fuel allowed per ship class. \n Wings are allowed but you must not use Wingman Navlock to drop out of

How ? \n \nYou have to document both your ship and its equipment by taking screenshots of both the weapons and modules tabs in the outfitting screen. \nYou also have to document your racing time by taking screenshots on the following locations: \n1. Just before pressing  \" Launch \"  in George Lucas - The clock has to be visible. \n2. At every  \" Kessel \"  station and outpost you dock at. Again, the clock and station name has to be visible. \n3. When you arrive in Jabbah, go into the Galaxy Map and take a screenshot. The clock and your location has to be visible. \n \nNormally, the F10-key is bound to taking screenshots. The images are normally located in the folder /Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Pictures/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous \n \n \n What's this nonsense about  \" Beauty shots \"  ? \n \nIn order to maximize the return on your investment in paint jobs for your ship, you have the opportunity to send in a beauty shot of your ship together with the outfitting shots. The beauty shots are to be taken as follows: \n \n1. Find a nice class F star in your vicinity and travel to it. Come to a complete stop as soon as you exit hyperspace and drop out of supercruise. \n2. Pitch and yaw your ship, so the center of the upper edge of the scanner is aligned with the lower right quadrant of the star, as shown in the picture. \n3. Enter the Debug Camera-mode and manoeuver your camera drone so it can take a screenshot of your ship from the upper left side. \n \n  \n \n \n \n So what do I do with all these pretty pictures ? \n \nYou convert all the bitmaps (.bmp) files into JPEG format to save space. \n \n WikiHow on BMP to JPEG conversion \n \nThen you put your images into one zip-file and mail it as an attachment together with your CMDR and ship details and  calculated  time to: \n \n stern.winter@buckyballracing.org.uk \n \nDon't delete the original screenshot files yet. In case of protests from other contestants, you have to be able to produce these .bmp files \n \n \n Ok, but what's in it for me ? \n \nYou're quite the mercenary. Wonder if you really care about anything. Or anybody. \n \nHolding first place in your class is an honor beyond measure, a reward in itself. And an assurance that you indeed are flying the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. \n \n \nThe race starts at 00:00 GMT 31. October 3301. No runs attempted before that time will count.  \nAll timed runs have to be submitted no later than 23:59:59 GMT 15.

The Bump'n'Grind Outpost Dash is a race around a circuit of outpost landings. What? I hear you cry, Outposts? I thought those had been excluded from Buckystyle runs? Well not any more. If you really enjoy having to go back to the start to swap your Anaconda for a smaller ship, if you can't get enough of those  \" docking permission denied \"  messages, if you thrill at the prospect of endlessly circling the station while you hunt for your designated pad only to find it hidden behind a ludicrously positioned control tower ... then this is the event for you. \n \nThe race starts at Crook Hub in the Toolfa system. Check yourself in to one of the luxury porta-loos that have been exclusively reserved for Buckyball Racing Club members, situated by the bins round the back of the station. Freshen up, get your overalls on, race tune the living heck out of your ship and then take a screenshot (F10) of the outfitting screen that clearly shows your internal modules, jump range, etc. Memorise the route (coming up in a minute), check your insurance policy is valid and say goodbye to your loved ones. \n \n Motorsport is dangerous. Death can, and no doubt will, ensue. DO NOT fly a ship you can't afford to lose. The organisers cannot accept any liability for loss or damage incurred as a result of participating in this race (we've spent our entire budget on luxury porta-loos). \n \nWhen you're physically and mentally prepared, remove your overalls, strap on your game face, return to the surface and take a screenshot prior to launch. Now mash that boost button and visit the following stations in the order given, taking further screenshots while docked at each one. \n \n \n  Poincare landing / Rasmussen  \n Thorne Station / Okinura  \n Whitworth Dock / Dvoruba  \n Gaffney Port / Ross 42  \n Low hub / Asgarage  \n Cady Hub / Toolfa  \n  Once you've scräped up the wreckage up from the final pad and reassembled it into something that vaguely resembles the ship you started out with, send an email to  alec.turner@buckyballracing.org.uk  including your complete set of screenshots (there should be 8 in total, so you might want to convert them to jpegs if you know how) along with the following information: \n \n \n your commander name  \n your forum name (if different)  \n the type of your ship  \n the name of your ship  \n the total elapsed time from Crook Hub pre-launch to Cady Hub landing (this can be calculated by feeding the times shown on those two screenshots into the following website:  http://www.timeanddate.com/date/timeduration.html# )  \n Additional info on screenshots can be found here:  http://www.buckyballracing.org.uk/entry.html \n \nThat's it. You're done! You may now eat your goldfish and bury your candy-floss. \nUnless ... hmmm, I can see the start line from here! \n \nSubmissions will be accepted from 00:00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 September 3301 until 23:59:59 GMT on Sunday 11 October 3301. \n \nThe winner will receive a stuffed bear (maybe). \n \nP.S. the race should be conducted in Open mode. As Bump Barnum once said ...  \" Solo and Private modes are for those afraid of what they might lose should they fail and if you're afraid of failure then you've already lost! \" . \n \nNote: the staff in the race commentary box (me? nope, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain) would appreciate any additional details and/or screenshots you'd care to share. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n IMPORTANT UPDATE \n \nFollowing detailed analysis of race tactics thus far it's become  apparent that, because of the short hyperspace distances involved in  this race, the need to trade-off heavy modules against jump range has  proved an unnecessary tactic. Consequently pilots are flying with a full  complement of shields. Delia Grind (who, coincidentally, has recently  entered into a lucrative business arrangement with local salvage  contractors) has persuaded judges that an exciting new amendment be made  to the Bump'n'Grind rules. \n \n     The Win It or Bin It joker card. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nAll pilots are now being issued with single use, Win It or Bin It joker  cards (these can be found in Ziplok bags under the seat of your  pre-assigned porta-loo marked  \" not to be shown to local health and safety representatives \" ). \n \nYour Win It or Bin It joker can be played on any single race submission whose screenshots clearly indicate: \n \na) that you have no shields fitted to your ship \nb) that you have not repaired your ship during the course of the run \nc) that you do NOT have a docking computer fitted \n \nIn accordance with findings from previous Buckyball races which show  that the removal of shields can often save an entire jump and thereby  shave around a minute off the time, playing your Win It or Bin It joker  will automatically remove one minute from your final time. \n \nTo play your joker simply include the phrase  \" WIN IT OR BIN IT \"  with  your race submission. Specify your actual elapsed time as normal and the  judges will subtract one minute from that time prior to recording it on  the scoreboard. Times modified with a Win It or Bin It joker will be  clearly marked with a  \" J \" . \n \nPlease note: only one Win It or Bin It joker is permitted per pilot per  ship type. In other words, if you play your Win It or Bin It joker too  soon and wish to use another one you will have to race with a different  type of ship in order to qualify. \n \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nSpeeding ticket bonus prize \n \nThe organisers of this event would like to stress that there is NO bonus prize for the largest total speeding fine accumulated during the course of any one Bump'n'Grind run. To even suggest such a thing would be to encourage reckless and dangerous flying which is definitely NOT something we wish to do. To be perfectly clear, under NO circumstances do we want you to include screenshots of your Transactions panel from the start and end of your run in order to validate any claim you might make for this prize since, as previously stated, it does NOT exist. Got that? \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \nExtract from Bump Barnum's unofficial biography entitled  \" Shoot at the sun and hit a star \" \n \nIn 3296 the great entrepreneur and showman Bump Barnum (no relation) met a local businesswoman by the name of Delia Grind (known to her employees as  \" Daily \" ) at a charity fundraiser in Toolfa. \n \nTheir evening began by outbidding each other during the auction of a vintage bottle of Chateau De Aegaeon and ended in a drunken argument concerning who was the better pilot. They decided to settle the debate with a point-to-point race around a series of nearby space stations but, not wishing to risk tarnishing their respective reputations as pillars of polite society by getting spotted engaging in such reckless behaviour, elected to use only backwaters and outposts. The end result was an unmitigated disaster. \n \nBump wrecked his Mk III Cobra at Gaffney port following a failed attempt to correct his approach to pad 2 from the wrong direction while Delia had to withdraw her Python from the race at Cady Hub after an altercation over landing rights for the medium pad ended in speeding fines and a lawsuit from the T6 pilot (who eventually settled out of court in exchange for keeping the whole thing out of the press). \n \nBump and Delia subsequently became great friends, frequently meeting up in the Crook Hub spacebar to relive the events of that day, embellishing the details of their escapade with each re-telling. As time passed and other pilots inevitably overheard snippets of the conversation the tale of Bump and Delia's madcap race began to evolve into the stuff of bar-room legend. \n \nAlthough never publicly admitting any truth to the story, neither was Bump Barnum one to let a good brouhaha go to waste and thus, the Bump'n'Grind Outpost Dash was born (along with a lucrative deal for the promotion of said event which kept Barnum and Delia supplied with Chateau De Aegaeon for many years to come).

Enoch  \" Little Nuk \"  Lonnegan -  \" The Lonnegan brothers \"  - is famous throughout the Bubble. \n \nThe brothers won't settle for anything less than an almost unlimited supply of the best booze and drugs from around the galaxy, plus some nice meat to grill on Tony's barbie. \n \nSo for two weeks before the party they run The Bootlegger Challenge - A big festival for the most badass, ice-cool space-truckers and smugglers from across the galaxy. It's the biggest rare-goods hauling event of the year, to prepare for the party of the year.  (In the Alacarakmo system at least). \n \n \n Fat Tony and Little Nuk Lonnegan ​ \n The Main Event - The Bootlegger Challenge. \n \nThe rules are simple, take off from Weyl Gateway (Alacarakmo) and visit any  eight  stations from the 21 listed. Return to Weyl Gateway with a hold stuffed with rare-goods from the list, including at least one ton from each of the eight stations. Fastest ship back to Weyl Gateway wins the race. \n \nEach class of ship has a minimum required delivery, ranging from 8 tons for the little fighters and couriers, up to 64 tons for the biggest ships. The minimum delivery is based on the size of internal-bay-2, with the exception of three classes (sidewinder, Eagle, Type-9). You can run with more if you want, but arriving with less means that your run doesn't count. \n \n This run must be made in open mode. \n \n But trucking isn't about speed, it's all about the credits man! \n \n Best Trader League. \n \nAs well as race to get back to Weyl the fastest, there's a separate award for the most profitable run. For this award, you can only trade using the commodities markets and black markets at the 8 stations that you choose plus Weyl Gateway. You can only visit each station once, and you must still make a minimum delivery of rares to Weyl as per the main race. Only commodity market profits and black market profits will count, not bounties, exploration data, etc; nor will fines penalise your score. You can deliver more than the minimum requirement to Weyl if you wish. \n \n This run must be made in open mode. \n \n \n The Black Riband - Sponsored by Evil Juice. \n \nThere is nothing that Fat Tony and Little Nuk like to hear more than the sad tales of traders shot up by pirates or fined by the Feds, the rumour is that they both suffer from  GRRM Syndrome  and actually gain sustenance from the tears of those around them.  \n \nFor this reason Little Nuk dreamed up The Black Riband - he likes to tell everyone that this trophy is to recognise  \" the best smuggler in the galaxy \" , but the reality is that Nuk is running sweep bets on how many pilots will be killed and what the biggest fine/insurance claim will be. \n \nThe holder of the Black Ribband is the CMDR who makes a run out of Weyl Gateway and makes it back to make an 8/16/32/64 ton 'minimum delivery' for their ship class the fastest.  \n \nTo qualify the run must be to the following systems: Bast, Eranin, Kappa Fornacis, Lave, Leesti, Rusani, Tarach Tor and Wuthielo Ku. On returning to Weyl you must have a hold stuffed completely full of Bast Snake Gin, Eranin Pearl Whiskey, Lavian Brandy, Leestian Evil Juice, Onion Head, Rusani Old Smokey, Tarach Spice and Wuthielo Ku Foth - with at least one ton of each product. \n \n There will be no leaderboard for The Black Riband, only the current holder and a list of previous holders.  \n \nThe Black Riband will run indefinitely. For as long as I'm posting on these forums, I'll continue to maintain the list on behalf of Little Nuk. As the list of available rares changes from time to time, the list may require adjusting occasionally when availability of a particular rare is removed.  \n \nIf and when that happens the current holder will be invited to make a fresh run using the new list, and that will become the time to beat. If they forfeit then the previous holder will have the chance to reclaim the Riband and set a new baseline time. The eight items on the list will always be either illegal or from notorious pvp systems. And the Riband will only ever be for open-mode runs. \n \n This run must be made in open mode. \n \n This is all well as good, but I hate hauling loads of cargo, my ship's built for speed! I'm a courier and courier missions don't need more than a 4t cargo rack, I'm outta here! \n \nWell in the best tradition of ElectricZ I can only say, if you don't like my race, you can always take a trip to Hutton Orbital. In fact that brings me onto the final event in Tony and Nuk's Trucker festival... \n \n The  \" Mrs Lonnegan's Ultimate Spa Weekend Trophy \" \n \nThere is nothing that Fat Tony's long suffering wife Carmela Lonnegan loves more than a nice relaxing Spa weekend, especially after a row with Tony. Her favourite pampering products are kind of hard to get hold of though - A glass of Centauri Mega Gin (and tonic) and an application of Motrona Experience Jelly, followed by sensual massage using V Herculis Body Rub, and last but not least a refreshing cup of Void Extract Coffee from Ehrlich Orbital. \n \nTony knows that best way to save himself a headache is to give Carmela whatever she wants, so he talked Nuk into including the four pampering products on the race list, but so far no pilot has ever brought even a single canister of the goods back to the finishing line. \n \nSo this year, to make Carmela happy and to shut up all those whining couriers and racers, Tony is offering the  \" Mrs Lonnegan's Ultimate Spa Weekend Trophy \"  to the fastest pilot to leave Weyl Gateway, fly to each of the four distant stations/outposts and return with a single ton of each product. \n \n This run must be made in open mode. \n \nAlso in the best tradition of ElectricZ, I'm going to make the run once myself in  The Nomad , so if nobody else is dumb enough to make the dumbest rare run in the history of trading, then I get to win a race! Yay - go Raiko! Take that CMDR Alot!  \n \nI've never visited Hutton Orbital, or any of the other three, so I may as well do it once. \n \n \n OPEN MODE ONLY! \n \n What the heck is all this 'open mode' stuff about? I only run in Mobius, open's full of griefers! \n \nWell boo-hoo.    \n \nAll of these events are  open mode only , and that's because my grandma could make a rares-run in solo if she were still alive, and the Lonnegan brothers are only interested in your tears. But I realise that not every CMDR has 'The Right Stuff,' and that some would rather stick to solo or run a second ship in Mobius. So for those who want to run solo/private we have.... \n \n The Simulator \n \nThe Bootlegger Challenge isn't for everyone - hurtling around the galaxy, boosting in and out of stations at suicidal speed and dodging interdictions in some of the hottest systems in the Galaxy. \n \nSo Fat Tony has spared no expense putting together an awesome simulator of the bubble for any CMDR to practice their routes and hone their skills - be warned this simulator is no kids toy, you'll be up against the latest AI opposition programmed by the infamous AI expert Mistress Avory, and Fat Tony claims they're almost as deadly as real pirates! What's more, to have a go in his simulator you need to pay Tony a wager equal to the insurance value of your ship plus the value of any simulated cargo that you carry. If you make it back to virtual Weyl Gateway in one piece though, you'll get a big pay-out from Fat Tony equal to what you would have received making a real-life run - As Tony likes to say,  \" It's just like the real thing, but the plasma balls don't hurt! \" \n \n NOTE:  (This is a solo/private version of the  main event only , with exactly the same rules but no griefers/gankers/murders/pirates/CODE - If you don't like getting shot at by other CMDRs stick to this simulator. There are no solo versions of the Best Trader League, The Black Riband or the Spa Trophy, those three are  open mode only ). \n \n \n MINIMUM DELIVERIES \n \nAll of the races except for the Spa Weekend Trophy require minimum deliveries, made up entirely of the listed rare-goods from your 8 stations. For almost all of the ships the minimum delivery is equal to the capacity of the second internal-bay slot in their ship. The only exceptions are the sidewinder and eagle, because it needs to be at least 8 tons, and the Type-9 because if you're racing one of those you need all the help you can get, not some evil rule making you collect 128 tons! \n \nThe max-supply caps of most of the listed rares should be enough that averaging 8 tons per station isn't too big a problem, but those with the big ships might find themselves waiting for a commodities refresh and it might not be possible to fly the optimal route. Sorry guys, but you knew that rares running was best for smaller ships. My tip for 'best ship' for this race would be DBX for speed and Anaconda for profit, unless you can make it around the whole route in open in a fully loaded Type-9.  \n \nI’ve done the Black Riband run in order to set a baseline time for that race and it was easy to fill a 32 ton hold during the run without waiting for a refresh, but I would have struggled with 64 tons, so take care which stations you pick with the big ships. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n THE LISTS \n \n The Bootlegger Challenge and the Best Trader League \n \n ***IMPORTANT NOTICE: INDI BOURBON IS NOW SUPPRESSED BY THE BACKGROUND SIM AND IS NOT AVAILABLE*** \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n ***IMPORTANT NOTICE: INDI BOURBON IS NOW SUPPRESSED BY THE BACKGROUND SIM AND IS NOT AVAILABLE*** \n \n \n The Black Riband \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n \n The  \" Mrs Lonnegan's Ultimate Spa Weekend Trophy \" \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n AZURE MILK! \n \n But that's not fair, Leesti sells two rare goods, what about Azure Milk? \n \nIt's the  Bootlegger  challenge, and you seriously want to haul milk? Would that be bootleg Milk? Really? \n \nNow get outta here before Nuk sees you!  \n \n \n SCREENSHOTS \n \nWhichever race you enter I need the following screenshots: \n \n \n Outfitting screenshots showing your FSD / Thrusters / Reactor as usual. \n A screenshot on the pad at every station, showing the station clock before launch. \n A final time screenshot when you land back at Weyl Gateway showing the station clock. \n Screenshots from the Commodities Market and/or Blackmarket at Weyl Gateway showing the cargo that you arrived with, plus the station name and clock. \n Alternatively if you are going to upload your runs to YouTube or elsewhere, then just provide your start and end time screenshots. Then just make sure that you upload a recording of your best run within 24 hours of the race ending and send me a link to the recording. Or post the link here if you'd like everyone to watch. \n \n \nFor the Best Trader League you also need to provide: \n \n Screenshots from the Commodities Market / Black Market for every purchase and sale of commodities your run. \n \nYour score will be the total profits from these screenshots from your 8 chosen stations and from Weyl Gateway. Remember this profits “race” isn’t timed, so take care not to miss out these screenshots, as there is no other way to fairly validate your run. \n \nUnfortunately for the Best Trader League I do need your screenshots rather than a video link, as I don’t think I’ll have enough time to validate scores by checking though YouTube videos. I will however accept screenshots that you’ve taken from your recordings, so it’s worth recording your run in case you forget to hit F10 during a transaction. \n \nPlease either put your screenshots together into a zip, rar or 7z file or upload them into a single album on a site like imgur and then email me a link (or a zip file) at the following email address: \n \n raiko@buckyballracing.org.uk \n \nFor more guidelines about how to enter and compete in our races, please take a look at  www.buckyballracing.org.uk \n \n So How Do I Enter? \n \nFirstly post your intent to race here, include your CMDR Name, open or solo, your Ship Class and a name for your ship. Like this: \n \nCMDR Raiko \nOpen \nShip Class: Asp Explorer \nShip Name: The Nomad. \n \n \nYou don't need to list which of the four races you're entering, just open/solo - but remember only the main event race has a simulator version, not the other three events. \n \nThen have a go at whichever races you like, one run could be entered into up to three of the events if you meet all the requirements, although the Black Riband or Spa Trophy systems are unlikely to be either the quickest or the most profitable to visit. \n \nWhen you're finished email me your screenshots or a link to either screenshots or a video recording. \n \nPlease include the following details in the text of your email: \n \nCMDR Name \nRace: (Bootlegger / Best Trader / Black Riband / Spa Trophy / Simulator ) \nShip Class \nShip Name \nTotal Time (or total profits for the Best Trader League) \n \nTo qualify your starting time must be no earlier than 00:00:01 GMT on Saturday 15 August 3301 and your finishing time must be no later than 23:59:59 GMT on Sunday 30 August 3301. \n \nI'll accept emails up to 24 hours after the end of the race, but your run must have finished before the end of the race, and all screenshots / video recordings must be available before the +24 hour deadline \n \nPlease send only one email per run, even if your run is being entered into more than one of the events.

race of the season. \n'THE PLEIADES HIP HOP'  1st August 3301, 00.00GMT to 9th August, 23:59 GMT \n \n RACE CLASSES:- \n     OPEN UNLIMITED  ( any ship piloted in open ) \n     SOLO UNLIMITED  ( any ship piloted in solo ) \n \n RACE BACKGROUND:- \n Two racers in the Ohm Horizons bar at HIP 29312 bet each other they could visit the Seven Sisters  \nand be back at the station before the bar closed in 30 minutes - the Pleiades Hip Hop was born! \n \n HOW TO TAKE PART:- \n START AT OHM HORIZONS HIP 29312 (take screen shot of time before launch) \n visit:- (in any order, taking 1 screenshot of time and current location in galmap of each star, NOT system map)  \n ASTEROPE \n CELAENO \n MEROPE \n STEROPE II \n MAIA \n PLEIONE \n ATLAS (why is this sister a brother?) \n FINISH LANDED AT OHM HORIZONS HIP 29312 (take your last screenshot of the time) \n \n Send a link or zip of your 9 screenshots and your pilot name, class (open or solo), ship name and time, \n under the subject BRCWUR01 to :- \n  BRCWUR@buckyballracing.org.uk \n before the end of the race date. \nyou can use  http://www.timeanddate.com/date/timeduration.html#  to calculate your time. \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \n F.A.Q. \n What's going on? \nThe Buckyball Racing Club warm ups are a chance to tweak your load outs or smash yourself into the toaster rack  \nand generally practice for the main BRC events in short races. \nAll pilots are welcome and the BRC strives to remain neutral in the galaxy and focuses on racing.  \nRaces are individual timed races that a pilot can run multiple times during the race shedule (usually a week) to get the best time. \nAll submitted pilot times are then collated on a board and at the end of the race the winner is the pilot with the best time. \n \n Do I need to register? \nFor normal BRC events you are asked to post an intent to run and that puts you on the starting grid.  \nFor the warm ups you can just turn up and race and send a time. \n \n When is the race running? \nThe race will be open for pilots from 1st August 2015, 00.00GMT to 9th August, 23:59 GMT.  \nOnly times submitted within this duration are eligible for the board.  \n \n How long will this take? \nYou should be able to complete the race in under 30 minutes. but it doesn't really matter if you don't, take your time,  \ntake a fully loaded type 9 just for the giggles. \nThe fastest pilot in a particular ship type usually gets a mention. \nOhm horizons is a High tech station, it doesn't have everything but you should be able to fit small ships there if not big ones. \n \n What am I doing again? \nFly your chosen race ship to Ohm Horizons in Hip 29312. Dock up, make a cup of tea and \nplot a course to one of the Seven Sisters (the big blue stars in the Pleiades nebula) \nThen take a screenshot showing the time and launch... fly as quickly as you can to your first sister,  \nthen when you've got there open up the galmap and take a screenshot  \n(making sure the screenshot shows both your current location and the time) \nNow plot your next jump to another sister, repeat until you've visited (and taken screenshots at) all 7.  \nNow plot a course back to HIP 29312 and land at Ohm Horizons,  \nas you touch down and the time comes up take your last screenshot,  \ncongratulations you've just completed the Pleiades Hip Hop, let's hope the bar is still open! \n \n So I can fly any ship in open or solo? \nYes, you can fly one or the other or both, but you'll need to submit times for each class you enter. \n \n What screenshots do I need? \n shots like this so I can verify you were in the system please. \n\n\n \n\t \n\n\t\t Spoiler \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n This example from galmap shows current location and time. \n \n So once i have the screenshots i zip them and send them to the email, what about a video? \n You can convert your images to jpgs if sending a zip of bmps is to big. \nor you can use imgur or some other site you can upload pics too. \nand a link to any video you make rather than the video. \n \n What's to stop me cheating? \nNothing.. but if you're going to fake times you have to get to the start grid anyway...  \nso why not just put the effort in to making a run?  \nYou're so clever with all your image manipulation skills you'd make a good racer,  \n just have a go - it's not about the winning. \n \n What is this farce?... I demand to speak to Bucky! \nYou're right of course, and we hope the Buckyball Run will return, but Bucky's not here at the moment...  \nwe have a Buckybot and he just says one thing: 'Shut up and race!'
